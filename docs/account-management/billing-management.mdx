# Billing Management

Use this page to check per-unit pricing for models, services, and components in SmythOS. This helps you forecast costs, avoid surprises, and use credits wisely. You can also [view subscription plans](/docs/account-management/overview) for limits and credit multipliers.

<InfoCallout title="Using SmythOS-managed models">
You don’t need API keys for default models. SmythOS manages setup, billing, and usage limits.
</InfoCallout>

## Billing Principles

<TipCallout title="Avoid surprise charges">
Monitor usage from the [Analytics Dashboard](https://app.smythos.com/analytics), and set limits on the [My Plan](https://app.smythos.com/my-plan) page.
</TipCallout>

- Each plan includes monthly credits
- Overages are billed **pay-as-you-go**
- Charges apply only after credits are exhausted
- External API model charges are non-refundable
- Failed runs or tests in development are never billed

## Core Services and Components

### Execution Costs

| Service        | Rate                                 |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Weaver Engine  | $3.00 input / $12.00 output per 1M tokens |
| Task Execution | $0.001 per completed task             |
| NodeJS Runtime | $0.0001 per second                    |
| Vanilla JS     | Free                                  |

**What counts as a task?**
- 1 component = 1 task
- Bulk run with 100 rows × 2 components = 200 tasks
- Failed runs = 0 tasks
- Development/test runs = Free

<WarningCallout title="Production-only pricing">
Task costs only apply in live deployments. Testing in the builder is always free.
