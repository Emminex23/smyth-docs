# GitHub Content Manager Agent

The **GitHub Content Manager Agent** is designed to help you **manage your GitHub repository content** directly through SmythOS, eliminating the need for manual file handling or complex API scripts.

The agent's capabilities include:

- Retrieving all repository content or specific file content (e.g., `README.md`)
- Decoding base64 file content for human readability
- Creating new files and committing them to the repository
- Updating existing file content with a new commit

<Youtube videoId="HCzyC1vAd7Q" title="SmythOS - Github Content Manager Agent" />

<InfoCallout title="Why use this agent?">
This agent simplifies repository maintenance, allowing non-developers to perform crucial content updates (like updating a documentation file) or enabling automated, scheduled content synchronization between systems and GitHub.
</InfoCallout>

## Use Cases

- **Automated Documentation Updates**
  Automatically push content generated by other agents (like SEO articles or release notes) into your repository's documentation files (e.g., `README.md`).

- **Version Control and Auditing**
  Programmatically log and commit changes from a business application directly to a GitHub repository, ensuring a verifiable version history.

- **Developer Productivity**
  Enable non-developers (e.g., technical writers, product managers) to manage simple file changes without cloning the repo or using the command line.

<TipCallout title="Pro tip">
Always ensure your GitHub Access Token has the necessary `repo` scope permissions for the agent to successfully create, update, and read files in your repositories.

## Testing the Agent

### Step 1: Access the Agent

<Image src="/docs/img/github_content_manager_agent/Homepage.jpg" alt="GitHub Content Manager Agent template in SmythOS Templates" />

- Go to the **Templates** section in the sidebar
- Find the **GitHub Content Manager Agent** and click **Remix**

<Image src="/docs/img/github_content_manager_agent/Remix.jpg" alt="GitHub Content Manager Agent template Remix in SmythOS" />

- The full workflow will open in Agent Studio

### Step 2: Set Up Credentials (GitHub Access Token)

The agent requires a **GitHub Personal Access Token** to interact with your repositories.

#### Generate GitHub Access Token

1.  Navigate to [https://github.com](https://github.com).
2.  In the upper-right corner of the page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.

3.  In the left sidebar, scroll down and click **Developer settings**.
4.  In the sidebar, click **Personal access tokens** then click **Generate New Token (classic)**.
<Image src="/docs/img/github_content_manager_agent/Image 4.png" alt="alt text"/>
5.  Add a descriptive note to your token, set the expiration, and then checkmark the **`repo`** scope (required for read/write access).
<Image src="/docs/img/github_content_manager_agent/Image 5.png" alt="alt text"/>
6.  Click the **Generate Token** button and **copy the token immediately**, as you will not be able to see it again.

#### Connect Token to Agent

1.  Store the copied token securely in your SmythOS Vault.
2.  In Agent Studio, click the gear icon on the **GitHub integration components** and select your stored token from the Vault for each component to save the configuration.

### Step 3: Run the Agent

You can test the agent via the conversational interface or the Form Preview.

**Testing a File Creation (Form Preview)**

<Image src="/docs/img/github_content_manager_agent/Form Preview.jpg" alt="Testing GitHub Content Manager Agent from Form Preview" />

1.  Click **Test** (top-right) and switch to **Form Preview**.
2.  Fill in the required inputs for creating a new file (e.g., `Action: Create File`, `Repo Owner`, `Repo Name`, `File Path`, and `Content (Base64)`).
3.  Click **Run** to execute the file creation and commit.

**Testing via Chatbot**

-   Click the **ChatBot** icon and provide a prompt for file creation or update using the required parameters. For example:
    - *Update the file content in SmythOS-GitHub-Manager: File content: dXBkYXRlIHN1Y2Nlc3NmdWw=, Path: text11.txt, Commit message: agent message, Name: janice, Email: janice@inkco.co*

<Spacer size="lg" />

## Deploying the Agent

### Step 1: Start Deployment

<Image src="/docs/img/github_content_manager_agent/Deploy.jpg" alt="Deploy button in SmythOS Agent Studio" />

- Click **Deploy** (top-right corner of Agent Studio)
- Pick your environment:
  - **Agent Cloud** (default, fully managed)
  - **Enterprise** (self-managed, secure)
  - **Local Runtime** (for development and offline use)

<Spacer size="md" />

### Step 2: Choose Your Deployment Type

Pick how users will interact with your agent.

- **Custom GPT** – Add instructions, behaviors, or tools
- **Chatbot** – Deploy a conversational agent that can interact with users via chat interfaces.
- **LLM** – Connect to large language models with API keys for flexible integrations.
- **API** – Use API endpoints to programmatically call your agent from applications or services.
- **MCP** – Use Model Context Protocol for structured workflows.
- **Alexa** – Launch as a voice assistant skill.

You can find detailed guides to them by reading the *[Deploy Your Agent As...](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/)* page.

<InfoCallout title="Best option">
For internal use by non-developer teams, deploy as a **Chatbot**. For integration with CI/CD or internal tools, deploy to **API**.
</InfoCallout>

## Customization Tips

<TipCallout title="Example customization">
To track repository issues, integrate the **GitHub Issues** component into the workflow. You could create an endpoint that accepts a natural language query and opens a new issue in a specified repository.
</TipCallout>

- **Automated Base64 Handling** – Add a `Code` component to automatically convert text inputs to Base64 *before* calling the GitHub Create/Update file actions, making the agent easier to use.
- **Error Reporting** – Implement custom error handling to notify users via email or Slack if a commit fails due to authentication or file path issues.
- **Branch Management** – Modify the workflow to accept an optional `branch` input, allowing the agent to commit changes to a feature branch instead of the default branch.
- **External Triggers** – Integrate a **Schedule** or **Webhook** component to trigger content updates automatically (e.g., nightly sync of documentation).
- **Security** – Use a dedicated, limited-scope token for different actions (e.g., read-only token for content retrieval) to enhance security.
