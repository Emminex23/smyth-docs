  <summary>Why Integrate GitHub with Your Agent?</summary>

Integrating GitHub with SmythOS allows your agents to become powerful assistants in your software development lifecycle:

- **Automate Code Commits:** Agents can commit configuration files, documentation updates, or even generated code directly to repositories based on external triggers or data processing.
- **Intelligent Issue Management:** An agent can monitor external systems (like a bug tracker or customer feedback tool) and automatically create corresponding GitHub issues, assign labels, or update their status.
- **Pull Request Automation:** Agents can be configured to create pull requests when new feature branches are ready, or to fetch details of open PRs for daily summaries or to check for merge conflicts.
- **Release Monitoring:** Agents can fetch information about the latest releases, allowing other systems to be updated or notifications to be sent when new software versions are published.
- **Repository Health Checks:** Schedule agents to perform routine checks, like counting open issues, fetching commit activity, or ensuring branch naming conventions are followed.

By connecting GitHub, you enable your agents to interact directly with your codebase and development processes, reducing manual overhead and enabling more sophisticated DevSecOps automations.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the integration, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup).)
- A **GitHub Account** with access to the repositories you plan to integrate with.
- A **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the appropriate scopes (permissions).

<Divider />

## Getting Started With GitHub

The connection between SmythOS and GitHub is configured using a secure Personal Access Token (PAT).

### Step 1: Generate Your GitHub Personal Access Token
1.  **Sign in to GitHub** and navigate to your **Settings**.
2.  Go to **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens** > **Tokens (classic)**.
3.  Click **Generate new token (classic)**.
4.  Give your token a descriptive **Note** (e.g., "SmythOS Integration").
5.  Set an **Expiration** period.
6.  **Select scopes:** This is critical. For broad functionality, check the main **`repo`** scope. This grants full control of private repositories, including code, issues, and pull requests.
7.  Click **Generate token**.

### Step 2: Copy and Store Your Token
- **Important:** GitHub will show your new PAT **only once**. Copy the token immediately.
- For security, store this token in the SmythOS **Vault**. Create a new secret named `github_pat` and paste your token as the value. [Learn more about the Vault here.](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/vault-sharing)

    <WarningCallout title="Secure Your Personal Access Token!">
    Your GitHub PAT is like a password. Treat it with extreme care. Do not commit it to repositories or share it publicly.
    </WarningCallout>

### Step 3: Configure the GitHub Integration in SmythOS
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any GitHub component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings**.
3.  In the `Access Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `github_pat`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for all GitHub components in that agent.

<InfoCallout title="Token Scopes & Permissions" collapsible >
If your agents encounter permission errors, the most common reason is that the PAT used for the integration lacks the required scopes. You may need to generate a new token with broader permissions (like the full `repo` scope) and update the secret in your Vault.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Personal Access Token (PAT):** Treat your PAT like a password. Store it securely using SmythOS Vault and grant it only the minimum necessary scopes.
* **Use ETags for Caching:** For GET requests, GitHub returns an `ETag` header. You can use this to make conditional requests to save API quota if the data hasn't changed.
* **Pagination:** For components that list multiple items (issues, PRs, commits), always check the `Link` header in the `Headers` output to handle paginated results correctly.
* **Clear Commit Messages:** When using components like `Commit File` or `Merge Pull Request`, ensure your agents provide clear, descriptive commit messages for a clean Git history.
* **Branching Strategy Awareness:** When automating branch creation or merging, ensure your agent's actions align with your team's branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow).

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **`401 Unauthorized` Errors:**
    * **Cause:** Your PAT is invalid, revoked, or lacks the necessary scopes.
    * **Solution:** Verify the PAT is correct and active in your GitHub settings. Ensure it has the required scopes (e.g., `repo`).

* **`404 Not Found` Errors:**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, `issue_number`, or other identifier. The resource may not exist, or your token may lack permission to see it.
    * **Solution:** Double-check all identifiers for typos. Verify the resource exists on GitHub and that your PAT has sufficient permissions.

* **`422 Unprocessable Entity`:**
    * **Cause:** The request is malformed. Common when updating a file with the wrong `sha`, or creating a pull request where branches are invalid.
    * **Solution:** Review all inputs to the component. For file updates, ensure you have the latest blob `sha`. For PRs, check that the `head` and `base` branches are correct and distinct.

* **`409 Conflict`:**
    * **Cause:** The operation cannot be completed due to the current state. For example, trying to merge a PR with merge conflicts.
    * **Solution:** Resolve the conflict manually on GitHub before re-attempting the API merge.

## What's Next?

With SmythOS integrated with GitHub, you can automate your entire development lifecycle.

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Automatically creates a feature branch, a draft pull request, and a tracking issue when a new task is created in your project management tool.
    * Monitors open pull requests and, once approved by two team members, automatically merges the PR and deletes the source branch.
    * Fetches the latest release notes and posts them to a company-wide Slack channel.
* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Trigger GitHub actions from an incoming [Email](/docs/integrations/email).
    * Log repository activity, such as new issues or commits, to a [Google Sheet](/docs/integrations/google-sheets) for reporting.
    * When a new user signs up in [Firebase](/docs/integrations/firebase), automatically invite them to a specific GitHub repository.
