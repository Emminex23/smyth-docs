# Introduction

<InfoCallout title="What is Agent Studio?"> **Agent Studio** is the cloud-based visual interface for building, testing, and managing agents in SmythOS. You define workflows using modular [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components) that control how an agent reasons and acts. It’s a complete environment where you can connect LLMs, enterprise data, and thousands of third-party tools into secure, human-supervised automations. </InfoCallout>
This documentation walks you through everything from a 2-minute quickstart to deep dives on advanced topics like [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-search), multi-LLM routing, and [deploying agents to production](/docs/agent-deployments/overview).

## What is Agent Studio?

Agent Studio is a visual canvas designed to simplify the creation of complex AI agents. It provides a suite of tools that let you:

* **Visualize Workflows:** Instantly test, inspect, and refine your agent's logic as you build.
* **Integrate Seamlessly:** Connect your agent to any process on the internet, from internal tools using [webhooks](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-webhook) to thousands of third-party APIs.
* **Handle Multiple Inputs:** Define custom inputs and outputs to process text, images, files, and structured data.
* **Build with AI:** Leverage advanced components for classification, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making.
* **Customize Everything:** Modify every aspect of your agent, from its core logic to its final [deployment](/docs/agent-deployments/overview), with unparalleled control.
