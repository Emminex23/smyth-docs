# SRE Deployment

> Getting your AI agents up and running fast matters. SRE’s boot sequence and configuration options make startup smooth and scalable.

<InfoCallout>
**What you need to know:**  
From initializing core services to connecting LLM providers, SRE’s boot process is designed for reliability and flexibility.

## Steps for Boot Sequence 

1. Initialize core runtime services like storage, cache, vault, and accounts  
2. Setup AI infrastructure including vector databases and model providers  
3. Register agent management services and components  
4. Establish API routing and HTTP endpoints  
5. Connect to LLM providers and authenticate  
6. Signal readiness and accept agent workloads  

```typescript
// Example: booting SRE with config
const sre = SRE.init({
  Storage: { Connector: 'S3', Settings: { bucket: 'my-bucket' } },
  Cache: { Connector: 'Redis', Settings: { url: 'redis://localhost' } },
  LLM: { Connector: 'OpenAI', Settings: { apiKey: 'sk-...' } },
  Vault: { Connector: 'HashicorpVault', Settings: { url: 'https://vault.company.com' } },
});

await sre.ready();
```

## Development vs Production Configuration

| Aspect           | Development default        | Production upgrade               | Impact on your code           |
|------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Caching          | RAM (in-memory)            | Redis cluster                  | ✅ No code changes required   |
| Storage          | Local filesystem           | S3 or enterprise storage       | ✅ No code changes required   |
| Authentication   | Dummy (no auth)            | Enterprise SSO/LDAP            | ✅ No code changes required   |
| Monitoring       | Console logs               | Structured logging and APM    | ✅ No code changes required   |
| Secrets          | Environment variables      | HashiCorp Vault               | ✅ No code changes required   |
| Access control   | Open access                | Role-based permissions        | ✅ No code changes required   |

SRE lets your agents run unchanged while the underlying infrastructure evolves.
