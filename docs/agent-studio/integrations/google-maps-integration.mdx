# Google Maps Integration

`Google Maps` is a widely-used mapping service developed by Google. It provides detailed maps, satellite imagery, street views, and route planning functionality for users worldwide.

At `SmythOS`, we've seamlessly integrated with `Google Maps`, offering custom components that simplify the incorporation of its powerful services into your agents.

## Geocode Address

The `Geocode Address` component simplifies the retrieval of geographical coordinates for a specified address, enabling precise location identification.

### Settings

To initialize this component, execute the following steps:

1. Set up a new project in your `Google Cloud Platform` if you haven't one already.
2. Enable the **Maps JavaScript API** within your project's settings.
3. Generate an `API Key` that will be utilized by this component. Ensure to input this `API Key` into the designated section in the component's settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

Provide the following input to make effective use of this component:

1. **urlEncodedAddress `required<string>`:** The address you wish to geocode, URL-encoded to accommodate special characters and spaces.

> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs

Executing this component will yield the following outputs:

1. **Response:** An object containing the geocoding results, detailed with latitude and longitude coordinates.
2. **Headers:** HTTP headers from the `Google Maps` server response, which include metadata such as response status codes and content type.
3. **location:** The detailed location information format you specified.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.

## Get Nearby Places

The `Get Nearby Places` component is designed to streamline the discovery of nearby locations such as restaurants, coffee shops, or any other points of interest, within a specified radius from a designated location. This component offers a robust solution for local exploration and data gathering.

### Settings

To set up this component, follow these steps:

1. If not already created, start a new project in your `Google Cloud Platform`.
2. Enable the Maps JavaScript API for your project.
3. Generate an `API Key` and input this key into the designated field in the component's settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
