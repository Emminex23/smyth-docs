# Authentication

SmythOS provides multiple layers of authentication to secure your agents and their interactions with external services.

<InfoCallout>
Proper authentication is crucial for protecting your agents and the data they handle. Use the Vault for API keys and configure OAuth for user authentication.

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication

Store and manage API keys securely in the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault):

1. Add API keys to the Vault
2. Reference them in your agent components
3. Keys are automatically injected into requests

### OAuth Authentication

Configure OAuth for user authentication:

1. Register your app with the service provider
2. Add OAuth credentials to the Vault
3. Configure the OAuth flow in your agent

### JWT Authentication

Use JWT tokens for secure API access:

1. Generate tokens with your secret key
2. Add the secret to the Vault
3. Configure JWT validation in your agent

## Best Practices

1. **Never hardcode credentials** in your agent components
2. **Use the Vault** for all sensitive credentials
3. **Rotate keys regularly** for enhanced security
4. **Limit key scopes** to only what's needed
5. **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity
