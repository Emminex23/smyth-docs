# Async Component

The `Async` component manages asynchronous operations, enabling non-immediate process handling. It's particularly useful for operations that would otherwise cause timeout issues, such as processing large datasets or executing time-consuming tasks.

## Inputs

- **Flexible Inputs:** Define as needed. Each input generates a corresponding async output.

### ➕ Add Input
- **Name (Required):** Unique and concise.
- **Type:** Any, String, Number, Integer, Boolean, Array, Object, Binary, Date.
- **Color (Optional):** Adds visual clarity.
- **Optional (Optional):** For non-essential inputs.
- **Default Value (Optional):** Used if no specific value is provided.

## Outputs

- **JobID:** Reference ID for tracking async operations.

> **Note:** Each user-created input has a paired async output, unavailable in synchronous workflows.

## Key Considerations

> **🐞 Debugging Limitations**
> - **Debug Mode Unavailable:** The debug toolbar cannot be used in Async workflows, as they execute as separate workflows from the main process.
> - **Log Monitoring:** All async workflow executions are recorded in the Agent Settings > Logs section, allowing you to review how the async execution proceeded after completion.

### 🏆 Best Practices

#### 🛠️ Development Workflow
1. **Develop Synchronously First:** Build and test your workflow without the Async component initially, using debug mode to ensure proper functionality.
2. **Add Async Later:** Once your workflow operates as expected, integrate the Async component to handle timeout-prone operations.

#### ⏱️ For Timeout Issues
- If you're simply trying to solve timeout problems (such as with lengthy "for each" loops), you can use the Async component alone without needing the Await component.
- The Await component is only necessary when you need to retrieve results from the async execution within the same user session.

#### 🔔 Tracking Completion
A common question is: "How do I know when the async execution finishes?" Consider these options:

- **Implement Notifications:** Add notification mechanisms at the end of your async workflow:
  - 📧 Email notifications with results summary
  - 📱 SMS alerts
  - 💬 Slack messages
  - 🔄 Webhook calls to other systems
  - 💾 Database record updates

- **Result Storage:** Store processing results in a persistent location:
  - 🗄️ Database entries
  - 📁 File storage
  - 🔄 Updating application state

### 🎯 When to Use Async

- 📊 Processing large datasets (hundreds or thousands of items)
- ⏳ Long-running operations that exceed normal timeout limits
- 🔙 Background tasks that don't require immediate user feedback
- 🏋️ Resource-intensive operations that might block the main workflow
- 🕒 Scheduled processes that need to run independently
