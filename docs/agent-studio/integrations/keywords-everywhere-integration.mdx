The first step is to acquire your `API Key`:

   - Visit the Keywords Everywhere website and create an account or log in if you already have one.
  
2. **Navigate to API Key Section**:
   - Once logged in, go to the `API Key` section in your account dashboard.
  
3. **Generate API Key**:
   - Click on the button to generate a new API key. You can copy this key for later use.
  
4. **Copy the API Key**:
   - Ensure that you copy the generated API key. Treat this as sensitive information.
  
5. **Set API Key in SmythOS**:

#### Data Source

The data source field allows you to define where the keyword data is sourced from. It has the following options:
