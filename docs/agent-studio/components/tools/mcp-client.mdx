# 🌟 MCP Client

The **MCP Client** component enables integration with external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers in your SmythOS agents, allowing seamless communication with tools, systems, and data sources that support the MCP standard.

## Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard designed to standardize how AI assistants exchange context with external tools and systems. MCP allows AI applications to:

- Access files and documents
- Execute functions in external systems
- Maintain context across different environments
- Exchange information with databases and APIs through a unified interface

The MCP Client component serves as a bridge between your SmythOS agent and external MCP-compatible services.

## Important Limitations

>**Current Limitations:**
>- The MCP Client component in SmythOS currently only supports MCP servers that are exposed through the web
>- It does not support connecting to local MCP servers running on your computer
>- Local MCP server connections require a desktop application, which is not part of the current MCP Client component
>
>**Upcoming Features:**
>- Local MCP servers will be supported in the upcoming SRE Local CLI
>- This feature is currently under development

## Settings

### 🔗 MCP URL
Enter the Server-Sent Events (SSE) URL of the MCP server you want to integrate with. This URL is mandatory and must point to a valid MCP server endpoint.

### 🧠 Model
Select the model to use for processing requests. The component supports various models including:
- OpenAI models (GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, etc.)
- Claude models
- Other compatible LLMs

### ✍️ Prompt
Enter the prompt to be used during component execution. You can utilize template variables (e.g., `{{prompt}}`) to incorporate dynamic content from agent inputs.

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings
- **System Prompt**: Define behavior instructions for the MCP client. This works like a behavior prompt, providing context and guidance for how the MCP server should process requests.

---

## Inputs

The MCP Client component comes with a default input:

- **Prompt**: This input is automatically injected into the prompt field using the `{{prompt}}` variable. When you connect another component's output to this input, its value will be used in the prompt template.

To add additional inputs, click the "+" icon next to the **Inputs** label and enter required details:

- **Name:** Unique, short, self-explanatory (e.g., `query`)
- **Type:** Supports `Any`, `String`, `Number`, `Integer`, `Boolean`, `Array`, `Object`, `Binary`, `Date`
- **Color (optional):** Enhances visual clarity
- **Optional (optional):** Non-mandatory inputs can be marked as optional
- **Default Value (optional):** Predefined value used if no explicit value is supplied

---

## Outputs

The MCP Client component has a single built-in output named **`Output`**, containing the response from the MCP server.

To add additional custom outputs:
- Click the "+" icon next to the **Outputs** label
- Simply name your new output (e.g., `summary`, `metadata`, `status`)
- SmythOS automatically recognizes that the source data comes from the default Output
- No need to use prefixes like "Output.label" as SmythOS handles this internally

This simplifies creating multiple outputs from a single response, allowing you to route different parts of the MCP response to various components in your workflow.

## Use Cases

- Connect your SmythOS agent to external MCP-enabled AI systems
- Integrate with specialized tools and databases via MCP
- Extend your agent's capabilities with third-party functions and data sources
- Create multi-model workflows involving different AI providers

> **⚠️ Troubleshooting**
>
> If your MCP Client component isn't responding as expected:
>
> 1. 🔍 **Verify the MCP URL**: Ensure the URL points to a valid MCP server endpoint
> 2. 🔄 **Check Prompt Format**: Make sure your prompt properly instructs the MCP server
> 3. 🛠️ **Test in Debug Mode**: Enable debugging to view detailed execution logs
