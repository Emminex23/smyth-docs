# Building Agents with SRE

The **SmythOS Runtime Environment (SRE)** supports multiple ways to build and run agents. You can work visually in [**Studio**](/docs/agent-studio/overview), write agents with the [**SDK**](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide), or manage projects using the [**CLI**](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide). All three connect to the same runtime, so you can move between them without changing platforms.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Choose the workflow that fits your role and project. Designers can prototype visually, developers can extend with code, and teams can monitor and deploy agents in a consistent way.
</InfoCallout>

## Choosing a Workflow

| Method | Best for | What it offers |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview) | Non-developers, rapid iteration, collaborative teams | Drag and drop [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components), test in browser, share with teammates |
| [SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) | Developers, automation, CI/CD pipelines | Type-safe workflows in TypeScript, custom logic, programmatic testing |
| [CLI](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide) | Scripting, project setup, running Studio exports | Scaffold new projects, run `.smyth` files locally, integrate with build pipelines |

<TipCallout title="Reference projects">

## Building with Studio

Studio is the fastest way to get an agent running.

- Build workflows visually with [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components)  
- Test agents directly using chat, form preview, or API modes  
- Collaborate by inviting others into a [space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)  

For a hands-on walkthrough, see the [Studio Quickstart](/docs/agent-studio/quickstart).

## Building with the SDK

The SDK gives you full programmatic control in TypeScript.

**Minimal example**

```ts
{`import { Agent, Component } from '@smythos/sdk';

const agent = new Agent({ name: 'ClassifierAgent', model: 'gpt-4o' });

const llm = Component.GenAILLM({ model: 'gpt-4o' }, agent);
const classifier = Component.Classifier({ classes: ['positive', 'negative'] }, agent);

// Connect outputs
classifier.in({ Input: llm.out.Reply });
`}
```

- Define workflows as code and keep them version-controlled  
- Add [custom components](/docs/agent-runtime/components) or expose new [skills](#agent-skills)  
- Run tests locally or in CI/CD  

Explore more in the [SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) and [examples in the repo](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre/tree/main/examples).

## Building with the CLI

The CLI helps automate and bridge Studio and SDK workflows.

- Create new projects with `sre create`  
- Run Studio-exported `.smyth` files locally with `sre run`  
- Add commands into `package.json` or pipeline scripts  

See the [CLI Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide) and [Getting Started](/docs/agent-runtime/getting-started) for installation and setup.

## Extending with Custom Components and Skills

### Custom Components

Write reusable blocks by extending the `Component` base class.

```ts
{`import { Component } from '@smythos/sdk';

export class Uppercase extends Component {
  async process(input) {
    return { result: input.toUpperCase() };
  }
}
`}
```

Details are in the [Component Reference](/docs/agent-runtime/components).

<Spacer size="md" />

### Agent Skills

Expose functions that your agent can call directly.

```ts
{`agent.addSkill({
  name: 'getWeather',
  description: 'Return a simple weather forecast',
  ai_exposed: true,
  process: async (city) => ({ forecast: 'Sunny in ' + city })
});
`}
```

See more patterns in the [SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide).

## Monitoring and Debugging

SRE provides built-in observability:

- Execution traces for every component  
- Real-time logs via SSE streams  
- Debug mode for step-through inspection  
- Performance metrics such as tokens, memory, and latency  

Monitoring is available both in [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview) and in SDK projects. For internals, see the [Runtime Overview](/docs/agent-runtime/overview).

## Hybrid Workflows

You can combine approaches:

- Export a Studio workflow to extend it in the SDK  
- Import an SDK-built agent into Studio for visualization and debugging  
- Use Studio for orchestration and SDK for specialized custom logic  

See the [Hybrid Workflow Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/hybrid-workflows) for concrete patterns.
