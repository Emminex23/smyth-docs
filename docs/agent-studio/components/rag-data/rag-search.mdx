# RAG Search Component

The RAG Search component retrieves relevant pieces of information previously stored using the RAG Remember component. It enables memory-aware agents by finding and returning the most contextually relevant content chunks using vector-based search.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
RAG Search allows your agent to recall specific pieces of knowledge using semantic relevance. This enables more accurate and grounded responses without reprocessing entire documents.

## What You Will Configure

- Namespace
- Result Count
- Score Threshold
- Include Score
- Include Metadata

<Divider />

## Namespace

| Field | Required? | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Namespace | Yes | The memory index to search against. This must match the namespace used when storing content with the RAG Remember component. |

<TipCallout>
Use namespace labels like folders. Your agent will only search in the one you specify.
</TipCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Results Count

| Field | Required? | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Results Count | Yes | The maximum number of top matches to return. Common values range from 3 to 5. |

<Spacer size="md" />

## Score Threshold

| Field | Required? | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Score Threshold | Optional | Filters results based on a minimum similarity score between 0 and 1. A higher value returns only highly relevant results. Default is 0, meaning no filtering. |

<InfoCallout title="Filtering behavior">
If no results meet the threshold, the component will return an empty result set.
</InfoCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Include Score

| Field | Required? | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Include Score | Optional | When enabled, includes a similarity score (from 0 to 1) in each result, showing how closely the content matches the query. |

<TipCallout>
Use the slider to filter results. Use this checkbox to include the score in the output. These options are independent. You can filter without showing scores, or show scores without filtering.
</TipCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Include Metadata

| Field | Required? | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Include Metadata | Optional | If enabled, includes metadata such as document name, section, or tags if that information was provided during indexing. |

<InfoCallout>
This option has no effect if the indexed data did not include metadata originally.
</InfoCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Inputs

### Query

| Field | Required? | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Query | Yes | The natural language question or search prompt the agent will use to find relevant content. Can be a phrase, sentence, or keyword. |

<InfoCallout>
Use clearly phrased queries like "What is the patient discharge process" to get better matches.
</InfoCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Outputs

### Results

| Output  | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Results | A list of matched content items. Each item may include: <ul><li><strong>content</strong>: the retrieved text</li><li><strong>metadata</strong>: document info (if enabled)</li><li><strong>similarity</strong>: a score between 0 and 1 (if Include Score is enabled)</li></ul> |

### Example Output

```json

[
  {
    "content": "Patients must be discharged with documentation reviewed by both attending and nursing staff.",
    "similarity": 0.82,
    "metadata": {
      "document": "HospitalPolicy.pdf",
      "section": "4.3"
    }
  }
]
```

<InfoCallout>
The similarity score will only appear in the output if the Include Score checkbox is selected.
</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices

- Use specific, well-formed queries to get the most relevant results
- Set the score threshold between 0.6 and 0.8 when high confidence is required
- Enable score only if you need to inspect or act on result quality downstream
- Keep namespaces consistent between RAG Remember and RAG Search
- Include metadata if you need traceability or content routing

## What to Try Next

- Feed the results into a [GenAI LLM](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/gen-ai-llm) component to summarise or format responses
- Chain with conditionals based on similarity score for dynamic logic
- Use score filtering to avoid hallucinated or loosely matched content

<TipCallout>
RAG Search is most effective when paired with [GenAI LLM](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/gen-ai-llm). This gives you a grounded retrieval process followed by a high-quality language generation step.
