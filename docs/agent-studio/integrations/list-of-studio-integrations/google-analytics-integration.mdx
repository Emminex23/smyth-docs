## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Understand GA4 Quotas:** Be aware of Google Analytics Data API quotas (tokens per project per hour, concurrent requests, etc.). Design agents to be efficient. Use batch requests where appropriate.
* **Specific Dimensions & Metrics:** Request only the dimensions and metrics you need for each report to improve performance and stay within quota limits.
* **Filtering:** Utilize `dimensionFilter` and `metricFilter` in your report requests to narrow down results and retrieve more relevant data.
* **Date Ranges:** Use relative date ranges like `"7daysAgo"`, `"yesterday"`, `"today"` where possible for dynamic reporting.
* **Error Handling:** Parse the `Response` object for any errors returned by the API. Implement retry logic or notifications in your agents for failed API calls.
* **Real-Time vs. Standard Reports:** Use real-time reports for immediate insights into current activity. For historical analysis and trends, use standard reports.
* **Data Interpretation:** Familiarize yourself with GA4's data model, dimensions, and metrics to correctly interpret the report data.
* **Incremental Data Fetching:** For large datasets or ongoing monitoring, explore strategies for fetching data incrementally if supported by API features (e.g., using date ranges to avoid re-fetching all data).

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Authentication Errors (`invalid_client`, `redirect_uri_mismatch`, `invalid_grant`):**
    * *Cause:* Incorrect `Client ID`/`Secret`, misconfigured redirect URI, or issues with user consent/refresh tokens.
    * *Solution:* Verify credentials and redirect URI (`https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`) in Google Cloud Console. Ensure the user has granted necessary permissions. You may need to re-authenticate in SmythOS.
* **Permission Denied / `403 Forbidden` Errors (e.g., "User does not have sufficient permissions for this property"):**
    * *Cause:* The authenticated Google account lacks access to the specified `GA4_property_id`, or the OAuth token doesn't have the required scopes (e.g., `analytics.readonly`).
    * *Solution:* Confirm the user has access to the GA4 property in the Google Analytics interface. Check and update OAuth scopes in Google Cloud Console and re-authenticate.
* **Invalid Argument / `400 Bad Request` (e.g., "Invalid GaxProperty Id Format", "Invalid dimension name"):**
    * *Cause:* Incorrectly formatted `GA4_property_id` (should be `properties/YOUR_ID`), invalid dimension/metric names in the request body, or malformed request syntax.
    * *Solution:* Double-check the `GA4_property_id` format. Verify all dimension and metric names against the GA4 API documentation. Validate the JSON structure of your request body.
* **Quota Exceeded / `429 Resource Exhausted` Errors:**
    * *Cause:* Making too many API requests in a short period.
    * *Solution:* Optimize report requests (request less data if possible). Use "Batch Run Reports" for multiple reports. Implement delays or exponential backoff in your agents if making frequent calls. Check your project's quota in Google Cloud Console.
* **No Data Returned (`rowCount` is 0 or `rows` is empty):**
    * *Cause:* The GA4 property might not have data for the specified dimensions, metrics, and date range. Filters might be too restrictive.
    * *Solution:* Verify data exists in the GA4 interface for the query. Widen date ranges or simplify dimensions/metrics for testing. Check filter logic.
