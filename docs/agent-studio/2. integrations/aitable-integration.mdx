`AITable`'s mission is to empower a billion humans with AI capabilities by providing a powerful but easy-to-use tool that is open source for everyone.

By using `AITable`, every individual, team, and company should be able to access and manipulate databases and data in ways never possible before, helping people save countless hours every day.

At `SmythOS`, we've seamlessly integrated with `AITable`, providing custom components that simplify the incorporation of its powerful services into your applications.

## Integration Settings

#### AITable API Token
To use AITable integration in `SmythOs`, you must authenticate each integration component with a AITable API token. Follow these steps to prepare your credentials:

1. Log in to `AITable` and click on your profile at the lower left corner. Navigate to the `My Settings` and proceed to `Developer Configuration`.
2. Select `+` to generate a new `API Token`.
3. Copy the `API Token`.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Token` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
