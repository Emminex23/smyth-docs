  <summary>Why Integrate Webflow with Your Agent?</summary>

Webflow's CMS is powerful and flexible. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build sophisticated content automation systems that save time and eliminate manual data entry.

- **Automated Content Pipelines:** Create agents that take content from a Google Sheet, Notion, or an AI model and automatically create new CMS items in your Webflow collections, such as blog posts, job listings, or portfolio pieces.
- **Real-Time Data Synchronization:** Keep your Webflow site in sync with external data sources. An agent can update product information, team member profiles, or pricing tables on your site whenever the source data changes.
- **Programmatic SEO:** Build agents that analyze your pages, generate optimized meta descriptions with an LLM, and then use the `Update Page Metadata` component to push those changes live.
- **Content Management from Anywhere:** Trigger content updates from other applications. For example, an agent could listen for a message in a Slack channel to update a "Team Members" page or publish a new blog post.

- A **Webflow account** with an active site.
- A Webflow **API Token**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Webflow

The connection between SmythOS and Webflow is configured using a secure API Token.

### Step 1: Get Your Webflow API Token
1.  Log in to your [Webflow account](https://webflow.com/).
2.  Click on your workspace, then select **Site Settings** for the site you want to connect to.
3.  Go to the **Integrations** tab.
4.  Scroll down to the **API Access** section and click the **Generate API Token** button.
5.  **Copy the generated token immediately.** It will not be shown again.

### Step 2: Store Your API Token in SmythOS Vault
Your API Token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Webflow API Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `webflow_api_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a Webflow Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Webflow component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `webflow_api_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Token from the Vault to **each** Webflow component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for each Webflow component.

### <a name="create-collection-item"></a>Create Collection Item
Creates a new item within a specified CMS Collection.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Token` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-webflow) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Component-Specific Settings
- **Body:** A JSON editor where you define the `fieldData` for the new item. The keys must match the "slugs" of your collection fields in Webflow.

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_id`| string | Yes | The unique ID of the collection where the item will be created. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | The unique ID of the newly created collection item. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Webflow API. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case">
An agent takes form submissions for new job postings and uses this component to automatically create a new item in the "Careers" collection on the Webflow site.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "webflow.createCollectionItem",
  "collection_id": "62e3c8f3b4bC1a4e19293a5c",

    }
  }
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Body Schema and Publishing">
The `fieldData` keys must match your collection's field slugs exactly. This component creates the item in a `staged` state; you must use the `Publish Item` component to make it live.
</WarningCallout>

<Divider/>

### <a name="update-collection-item"></a>Update Collection Item
Updates the fields of an existing item in a CMS Collection.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Token` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-webflow) section.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Webflow API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Master the CMS Workflow:** The standard automated workflow is: 1. `Create Collection Item` (or `Update Collection Item`). 2. `Publish Item`. You must explicitly publish items to make them live.
* **Understand the `Body` Schema:** When creating or updating items, the `fieldData` object in the `Body` is critical. The keys must be the "slugs" of your collection fields (which you can find in the Webflow Designer). Refer to the Webflow API documentation for the correct data structure for different field types (Plain Text, Rich Text, Images, etc.).
* **Start with `List` Components:** When starting a new workflow, it's often easiest to begin with `List Sites` and `List Collections` to programmatically find the IDs you need, rather than hardcoding them.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Token is incorrect, has been revoked, or does not have the necessary permissions.
  * **Solution:** Verify the API Token in your SmythOS Vault is correct. In your Webflow settings, check that the key is active and has the required scopes (e.g., `cms:write`).

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect `site_id`, `collection_id`, or `item_id` was provided.
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Use the `List` components to verify that the resource you are trying to access exists.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` / Validation Error**
  * **Cause:** The JSON `Body` payload for a create/update operation is malformed, missing required fields, or a field key does not match the collection's field slug.
  * **Solution:** Carefully validate your `fieldData` object. Ensure every key matches a field slug in your Webflow collection and that the value is in the correct format for that field type.

* **Items are Created but Not Visible on the Live Site**
  * **Cause:** You have successfully used `Create Collection Item` but have not yet used the `Publish Item` component.
  * **Solution:** After creating or updating an item, you must call the `Publish Item` component with the corresponding `item_id`(s) to push the changes to your live website.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful content management automations with the **SmythOS Webflow Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a headless CMS bridge. It reads product data from a [Squarespace](/docs/integrations/squarespace) or Shopify store and uses the `Create/Update Collection Item` components to keep a "Products" collection on your Webflow marketing site in sync.
    * Automates a job board. It scrapes new job listings from various career sites, and for each new listing, it creates a new item in a "Job Openings" collection on your Webflow site.
    * Connects to your social media. When you publish a new article to [Dev.to](/docs/integrations/devto), an agent takes the content and creates a corresponding blog post on your main Webflow site.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to generate a blog post, then use `Create Collection Item` and `Publish Item` to publish it.
    * When a new item is published, take its URL and share it across your social channels using the [Ayrshare Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ayrshare-integration).
    * Log every new CMS item created by your agents into a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) for content auditing and tracking.
