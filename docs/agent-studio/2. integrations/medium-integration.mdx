# Medium Integration

`Medium` is a renowned online publishing platform, providing a space for individuals, organizations, and businesses to share their ideas and stories with a vast audience.

At `SmythOS`, we've established seamless integration with `Medium`, delivering custom components that streamline the incorporation of their sophisticated services into your projects
