# Google Analytics Integration

`Google Analytics` is a powerful tool for understanding and enhancing website performance through data-driven insights. It provides detailed statistics about a website's traffic, user behavior, and content interactions, which are crucial for digital marketing success and website optimization.

Integrating `Google Analytics` into `SmythOS` enables users to directly access and leverage these analytics within their operational environment, streamlining workflows and enhancing decision-making processes. This integration facilitates real-time data access, allowing users to monitor their website's performance without switching between platforms.

#### Client ID & Client Secret

For a visual step-by-step guide, watch this [video](#google-oauth-setup).

To establish a secure connection with `Google Analytics` using `SmythOS`, you need authenticated credentials, specifically a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`. Here's a detailed guide on how to obtain these credentials for the `Google Analytics` API:

1. **Visit the Google Developers Console**: 
   - Navigate to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Select an existing project or create a new project dedicated to your integration.

2. **Enable the Google Analytics API**: 
   - Go to the `Library` section within the Developers Console.
   - Search for and enable the Google Analytics API for your project.

3. **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen**: 
   - Access the OAuth consent screen settings and fill in necessary information such as your application's name, support email, and the scopes required for your application.

4. **Generate Credentials**:
   - Visit the `Credentials` tab in the Google Developers Console.
   - Click `Create credentials` and choose `OAuth client ID`.
   - Select the application type that best represents your application.
   - Complete the configurations and specify the callback URL as `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback`. This URL is crucial as it handles the redirection after successful authentication.

5. **Authenticate in SmythOS**: 
   - Enter the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` in the respective fields within the SmythOS component settings.
   - Click the `Authenticate` button to finalize the connection and start utilizing Google Analytics with SmythOS.

> **Note:** Treat the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
