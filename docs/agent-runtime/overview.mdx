## What is SRE?

The Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) is the runtime platform built specifically for AI agents. It acts like an operating system designed to manage the complexities of agent execution, resource allocation, security, and integration with AI models and data services.

SRE lets you focus on creating intelligent behaviors without worrying about the infrastructure that runs your agents.

## Core Architecture

SRE uses a modular design inspired by operating system kernels. It separates **core runtime services** from **pluggable connectors**, which lets you:

- Swap or extend any service without changing your agent logic  
- Securely manage access with an enterprise-grade Candidate/ACL system  
- Scale efficiently with isolated resource management  
- Customize and extend connectors for your needs

## Why use SRE?

SRE is purpose-built for AI agents, so you get:

- A production-ready platform from day one  
- Seamless integration with multiple LLM providers  
- Built-in monitoring and debugging tools  
- Support for visual workflow design and SDK programming  
- Enterprise-grade security and scalability
