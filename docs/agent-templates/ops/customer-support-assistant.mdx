# Customer Support Assistant Agent

The **Customer Support Assistant Agent** automates customer service through an intelligent workflow that ensures **accurate and empathetic support interactions** at scale.

When a customer submits a question, the agent:

- Optimizes the query using **GPT-5-mini**.
- Searches the company **knowledge base** and **support history database** (RAG-based).
- Generates a professional, formatted response with proper citations.
- Includes **escalation recommendations** for complex issues.

<InfoCallout title="Why use this agent?">

## Use Cases

- **Streamlining Customer Support Operations**
  Automatically resolve customer inquiries by searching company knowledge base and support history using AI-powered query optimization. Eliminate manual ticket routing and information gathering while providing instant, accurate responses with proper formatting and source citations for consistent support quality.

- **Scaling Knowledge Base Utilization**
  Transform static documentation and past support conversations into dynamic, searchable resources that provide contextual answers to customer questions. Maximize the value of existing knowledge assets while reducing response times from hours to seconds without compromising accuracy or personalization.

<TipCallout title="Pro tip">
Integrate the agent's API endpoint directly into your existing help desk software (e.g., Zendesk, Freshdesk) to automatically draft the first response to every incoming ticket, freeing up human agents for high-complexity escalations.

## Customization Tips

<TipCallout title="Example customization">
To prioritize speed and consistency in responses, modify the `Response Generation` component to use a low temperature setting (0.0-0.1) and rely more heavily on the information retrieved from the RAG database rather than creative language generation.
</TipCallout>

- **Response Generation** – Switch between `GPT-5-mini` for faster responses vs `GPT-4o` for enhanced accuracy, adjust temperature settings (0.0-0.3) for consistency vs creativity balance, and modify token limits to control response length based on your support complexity requirements
- **Knowledge Base Sources** – Update `DataSourceLookup` namespaces with your company’s specific document collections, adjust `topK` values (3-10) for result quantity, and configure score thresholds (0.3-0.7) to filter relevant information quality
- **Query Optimization** – Customize `Query Optimizer` prompts to include industry-specific terminology, add company product names and feature keywords, and adjust search strategies for technical vs general customer inquiries
- **Response Formatting** – Modify `Formatted Response Generator` prompts for brand-specific tone and style, customize escalation triggers for complex issues, and add company-specific signature blocks or contact information for seamless customer experience
