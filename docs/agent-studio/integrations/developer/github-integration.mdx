## Why Integrate GitHub with Your Agent?

GitHub is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers a variety of collaborative features, allowing developers to work together on projects, track changes, and manage code repositories. Integrating GitHub with SmythOS empowers your agents to programmatically interact with your repositories, unlocking significant automation potential for your development and operational workflows.

- **Automate Repository Management**: Agents can create branches, commit files, and manage repository content based on triggers or scheduled tasks.
- **Streamline Issue Tracking**: Automatically create, update, or label GitHub issues based on events from other systems (e.g., a customer support ticket creating a bug report).
- **Enhance Pull Request Workflows**: Agents can create pull requests, add comments, merge branches (with conditions), or list PR details for reporting.
- **Automate Release Management**: Fetch information about the latest releases or trigger actions based on new releases.
- **CI/CD Integration & Notifications**: Use GitHub events (via webhooks, if SmythOS supports them, or by polling with agents) to trigger CI/CD pipelines or send notifications about repository activity.
- **Code & Content Search**: Programmatically search for code or content within repositories to gather information or monitor for specific patterns.

Essentially, this integration transforms GitHub from a developer-focused platform into an active, automatable component of your broader SmythOS ecosystem. This results in increased efficiency, better collaboration, and more streamlined development lifecycles.

<details>
  <summary>Why Integrate GitHub with Your Agent?</summary>

Integrating GitHub with SmythOS allows your agents to become powerful assistants in your software development lifecycle:

- **Automated Code Commits:** Agents can commit configuration files, documentation updates, or even generated code directly to repositories based on external triggers or data processing.
- **Intelligent Issue Management:** An agent can monitor external systems (like a bug tracker or customer feedback tool) and automatically create corresponding GitHub issues, assign labels, or update their status.
- **Pull Request Automation:** Agents can be configured to create pull requests when new feature branches are ready, or to fetch details of open PRs for daily summaries or to check for merge conflicts.
- **Release Monitoring:** Agents can fetch information about the latest releases, allowing other systems to be updated or notifications to be sent when new software versions are published.
- **Repository Health Checks:** Schedule agents to perform routine checks, like counting open issues, fetching commit activity, or ensuring branch naming conventions are followed.

By connecting GitHub, you enable your agents to interact directly with your codebase and development processes, reducing manual overhead and enabling more sophisticated DevSecOps automations.

## Prerequisites: What You'll Need to Get Started

Before you begin the integration, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. (If you're new to SmythOS, [you can sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup).)
- A **GitHub Account** with access to the repositories you plan to integrate with.
- You will need to generate a **GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)** with the appropriate scopes (permissions) to allow SmythOS agents to perform the desired actions on your repositories. Detailed steps are provided below.

<Divider />

## Step-by-Step: Connecting Your GitHub Account

To enable SmythOS agents to interact with your GitHub repositories, you need to generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from your GitHub account and then configure it within the SmythOS GitHub integration settings.

### Part A: Generating a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)

1.  **Sign in to GitHub:** Go to `https://github.com/` and log in to your account.
2.  **Navigate to Developer Settings:**
    * Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner of any page.
    * Go to **Settings**.
    * In the left sidebar, scroll down and click on **Developer settings**.
    * In the Developer settings sidebar, click on **Personal access tokens**.
    * Select **Tokens (classic)**. *While Fine-grained tokens are newer, Tokens (classic) are often used for broader API access required by integrations like this, unless SmythOS specifies support for Fine-grained tokens with specific repository access.*
3.  **Generate a New Token:**
    * Click the **Generate new token** button (you might be prompted to choose "Generate new token (classic)").
    * **Note:** Give your token a descriptive name, e.g., "SmythOS Integration".
    * **Expiration:** Choose an appropriate expiration period for your token. For long-running automations, you might choose a longer period or "No expiration" (use with caution and understand the security implications).
    * **Select scopes:** This is a critical step. You must grant the token permissions for the actions your SmythOS agents will perform. Common scopes include:
        * **`repo`**: Full control of private repositories (includes read/write access to code, commits, branches, issues, pull requests, etc.). This is often the most comprehensive scope needed for full interaction.
        * `workflow`: Allows actions related to GitHub Actions.
        * `admin:repo_hook`: For managing repository hooks, if needed.
        * `gist`: If interacting with Gists.
        * *Review the components you plan to use and select the minimal necessary scopes. For example, if you only need to read repository content, a more limited scope might be possible, but `repo` is a common requirement for broad functionality.*
    * Click the **Generate token** button at the bottom of the page.
4.  **Copy Your New Personal Access Token:**
    * **Important:** GitHub will display your new PAT **only once**. Copy the token immediately and store it in a secure location (like a password manager or SmythOS Vault). If you navigate away from the page or lose the token, you will need to generate a new one.

<WarningCallout title="Secure Your Personal Access Token!">
Your GitHub Personal Access Token is like a password to your account for API access. Treat it with extreme care.
- Do NOT share it publicly.
- Do NOT commit it to your repositories.
- Store it securely. SmythOS offers a `Vault` feature for managing sensitive credentials like PATs. [Learn more about SmythOS Vault here.](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/vault-sharing)
</WarningCallout>

### Part B: Adding the Personal Access Token to SmythOS

1.  **Navigate to SmythOS Integrations:** In your SmythOS dashboard, find and click on the "Integrations" section.
2.  **Add or Configure GitHub Integration:**
    * Look for "GitHub" in the list of available integrations and click to add or configure it.
3.  **Enter Your Personal Access Token:**
    * You will typically find a field labeled "Access Token," "Personal Access Token," or similar.
    * Carefully paste the PAT you copied from GitHub into this field.
4.  **Save Configuration:**
    * Click the `Save`, `Connect`, or `Authenticate` button within the SmythOS GitHub integration settings.
5.  **Connection Confirmed!** SmythOS should now be able to use this token to authenticate requests to the GitHub API on your behalf, according to the scopes you granted to the token.

<InfoCallout title="Token Scopes & Permissions" collapsible >
If your agents encounter permission errors when trying to perform certain GitHub actions, the most common reason is that the Personal Access Token used for the integration does not have the required scopes. You may need to regenerate the token (or generate a new one) with broader permissions (e.g., ensuring the `repo` scope is fully checked if it wasn't initially). Remember to update the token in SmythOS after regenerating it.

## Detailed Component Guides

This section provides detailed information for each GitHub component. Remember to refer to the [Understanding Common GitHub Component I/O Fields](#understanding-common-github-component-io-fields) and [Deep Dive Into GitHub I/O Fields](#deep-dive-into-github-io-fields) for explanations of common inputs (like `repo_owner`, `repo_name`) and outputs (like `Response`, `Headers`). Each component guide below will highlight specific inputs and outputs for that action.

### <a name="add-labels-to-issues"></a>Add Labels to Issues

The `Add Labels to Issues` component empowers users to add labels to issues reported in a GitHub repository.

<InfoCallout title="Use Case Example">
Automatically add a "bug" label to a new GitHub issue if it was created from a customer support ticket tagged as a product defect.
</InfoCallout>

#### Settings

To kickstart this component, follow these initial steps to obtain your `Access Token`:

1. Create a `GitHub` account if you don't already have one.
2. Navigate to your `Developer Settings` and generate and acquire your `Access Token` by clicking [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
3. Input this `Access Token` into the specified section in the component's settings (typically done at the integration level in SmythOS).

> **Note:** Treat the `Access Token` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

#### Inputs

| Field | Type | Required? | Description |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------|
| `repo_owner` | string | Yes | The account owner of the repository. The name is not case sensitive. |
| `repo_name` | string | Yes | The name of the repository without the `.git` extension. The name is not case sensitive. |
| `issue_number` | integer | Yes | The number that identifies the issue. |
| `label` | string | Yes | The name of the label to add to the issue's existing labels. To add multiple labels, you might need to provide them as an array of strings or use the component multiple times, depending on the specific implementation (e.g., `["bug", "priority:high"]` or a comma-separated string if supported by the underlying API call structure within the component). The provided text implies a single label string. For adding multiple, the component might accept an array in the `label` field or a JSON array in a `labels` field if available. If the component strictly takes one string, multiple calls would be needed. Assuming the input "label" is for a single label name based on the description. The API itself accepts an array of labels. |

<Image src="/img/github/screenshot2.png" alt="Inputs for Add Labels to Issues component" />
_Image: Inputs for the Add Labels to Issues component._

> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section. This could be used to pass an array of labels if the component supports it via a different field name (e.g., `labels_array`).

#### Outputs

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `Response` | object | A detailed JSON object containing information on the results of adding labels to an issue. It includes the updated list of labels on the issue or details about any encountered errors. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP Headers found within the server response from `GitHub`. These headers give additional context and metadata about the response, such as status codes and rate limit information. |
| `labels` | array | An array of objects, where each object represents a label now applied to the issue. Each label object typically contains `id`, `node_id`, `url`, `name`, `color`, `default`, `description`. This confirms the modification of the issue's labels. |

<Image src="/img/github/screenshot3.png" alt="Outputs for Add Labels to Issues component" />
_Image: Outputs from the Add Labels to Issues component._

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.

### <a name="create-branch"></a>Create Branch

The `Create Branch` component empowers users to create a new branch in a GitHub repository. It creates a new reference (branch) pointing to a specific commit SHA. You are unable to create new references for empty repositories (repositories without any branches), even if the commit SHA-1 hash used exists.

<InfoCallout title="Use Case Example">
When a new feature development starts (e.g., triggered by an "approved" status in a project management tool), an agent automatically creates a new feature branch (e.g., `feature/PROJECT-123-new-login-flow`) from the latest commit on the `main` or `develop` branch.
</InfoCallout>

#### Settings
(Refer to the "Settings" section under [Add Labels to Issues](#add-labels-to-issues) for details on obtaining and configuring your GitHub Access Token in SmythOS.)

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section.

<Divider />

### <a name="commit-file"></a>Commit File (Create or Update File)

The `Commit File` component empowers users to create a new file or update an existing file in a GitHub repository. If the file specified by `file_name` (path) doesn't exist, it will be created. If it does exist, this component (as typically implemented by GitHub's "Create or update file contents" API) would update it, but requires the `sha` of the existing file blob for updates. The provided description focuses on creating a new file.

<InfoCallout title="Use Case Example">
An agent generates a daily report and automatically commits it as a new Markdown file (e.g., `reports/daily-summary-YYYY-MM-DD.md`) to a documentation repository.
</InfoCallout>

#### Settings
(Refer to the "Settings" section under [Add Labels to Issues](#add-labels-to-issues) for details on obtaining and configuring your GitHub Access Token in SmythOS.)

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Personal Access Token (PAT):** Treat your PAT like a password. Store it securely using SmythOS Vault. Grant it only the minimum necessary scopes for the actions your agents will perform. Regularly review and rotate tokens if necessary.
* **Understand GitHub API Rate Limits:** Be aware of GitHub's API rate limits (typically per hour per user/token). Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` headers in the `Headers` output. Implement graceful handling (e.g., delays, retries with exponential backoff) in your agents if they make many requests.
* **Use ETags for Caching:** For GET requests, GitHub returns an `ETag` header. If the data hasn't changed, you can make a conditional request using the `If-None-Match` header with the ETag value. If data is unchanged, GitHub returns a `304 Not Modified` status, saving quota and bandwidth. (This might require custom API call configurations if not natively supported by components).
* **Pagination:** For components that list multiple items (issues, PRs, commits, files, etc.), always check for pagination information in the `Link` header (found in the `Headers` output) or use `page` and `per_page` parameters correctly to fetch all results if needed.
* **Idempotency:** Design agent workflows to be idempotent where possible, especially for write operations (creating branches, committing files, adding labels). This means if an operation is run multiple times with the same input, it produces the same result without unintended side effects (e.g., creating duplicate branches).
* **Clear Commit Messages:** When using components like "Commit File" or "Merge Pull Request," ensure your agents provide clear, descriptive commit messages.
* **Base64 Encoding for File Content:** For "Commit File" and "Update File Content," ensure the `content` input is correctly Base64 encoded. Plain text or binary data must be encoded first.
* **SHA for File Updates:** When using "Update File Content," providing the correct `sha` (blob SHA) of the file you intend to update is crucial to avoid conflicts and ensure you're modifying the intended version.
* **Error Handling:** Always check the `Response` object from components for error messages or non-successful status codes. The GitHub API provides informative error details.
* **Branching Strategy Awareness:** When automating branch creation or merging, ensure your agent's actions align with your team's branching strategy (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow).
* **Webhooks vs. Polling:** For real-time reactions to GitHub events, webhooks (if SmythOS can receive them) are generally more efficient than agents polling the API frequently. If polling, do so at reasonable intervals.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **`401 Unauthorized` Errors:**
    * **Cause:** Invalid, revoked, or missing Personal Access Token; Token does not have the required scopes for the action.
    * **Solution:** Verify the PAT is correct and active in your GitHub Developer settings. Ensure it has the necessary scopes (e.g., `repo` for most repository actions). Update the token in SmythOS integration settings.
* **`403 Forbidden` / Permission Denied Errors:**
    * **Cause:** The PAT has insufficient scopes for the specific resource or action, or the authenticated user lacks the necessary permissions on the repository/organization itself (e.g., trying to push to a protected branch without admin rights).
    * **Solution:** Check the PAT scopes in GitHub. Ensure the user associated with the PAT has the required permissions (e.g., write access, admin rights) on the target repository. For organization-owned repositories, check third-party application access policies.
* **`404 Not Found` Errors:**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect `repo_owner`, `repo_name`, `issue_number`, `pull_number`, `branch_name`, `path`, or other identifier. The resource genuinely does not exist or the PAT lacks permission to see it.
    * **Solution:** Double-check all identifiers for typos and case-sensitivity (though owner/repo are usually case-insensitive, branch names can be). Verify the resource exists on GitHub.com. Ensure PAT scopes allow access.
* **`422 Unprocessable Entity` (Often with file commits/updates or PR creation):**
    * **Cause:** Invalid request body, missing required fields for the API endpoint, or a business rule violation (e.g., trying to create a branch that already exists, commit an empty file without specific flags, or update a file with an incorrect SHA).
    * **Solution:** Carefully review the inputs provided to the component. For file operations, ensure `content` is correctly Base64 encoded. For updates, ensure the `sha` of the blob is correct. For PRs, ensure `head` and `base` branches are valid and distinct. Consult the `Response` body for specific error messages from GitHub.
* **`409 Conflict` (e.g., when creating a branch that already exists, or merge conflicts):**
    * **Cause:** The requested operation cannot be completed due to a conflict with the current state of the resource.
    * **Solution:** Check if the resource (e.g., branch) already exists. For merges, resolve conflicts manually on GitHub before attempting an API merge, or ensure the PR is mergeable.
* **Rate Limit Exceeded (`403 Forbidden` or `429 Too Many Requests` with specific error message):**
    * **Cause:** Making too many API requests in the allowed time window.
    * **Solution:** Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` in the `Headers` output. Reduce request frequency. Implement delays or exponential backoff in agent logic. Use ETags for conditional requests to save quota.
* **File Content Encoding/Decoding Issues:**
    * **Cause:** Incorrect Base64 encoding of file `content` when committing/updating, or incorrect Base64 decoding when retrieving file content.
    * **Solution:** Ensure standard Base64 encoding/decoding is used. For binary files, handle them appropriately during encoding/decoding.

For persistent issues, the `Response` object from the component is your most valuable tool. It contains the raw JSON error message from the GitHub API, which usually provides specific details about what went wrong. The SmythOS support team is also available to assist. [Link to SmythOS Support Page]

## What's Next?

With SmythOS now integrated with your GitHub account, your agents are equipped to automate a vast array of tasks within your software development lifecycle, enhancing productivity and consistency.

Here are some ideas to inspire your next automation:

* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Automatically creates a new feature branch ("Create Branch") and a corresponding tracking issue ("Create Issue" - if available, or via API call) when a new task is added to your project management tool.
    * Monitors pull requests ("List Pull Requests") for specific labels (e.g., "ready-for-qa") and then triggers a CI/CD pipeline or notifies the QA team.
    * On a new commit to the `main` branch ("Fetch Commits since Timestamp" or webhook trigger), fetches the latest release tag ("Fetch Latest Release"), increments it, and prepares a draft release.
    * Periodically checks for stale branches ("List Branches" - if available, or via API call) that haven't had commits in a long time and notifies the owner or archives them.
    * When a new critical issue is labeled ("Get Issue Labels", triggered by webhook or polling), automatically assigns it to a specific team member or posts a notification in a dedicated Slack channel.
* **Enhance Your Workflows by Combining Data & Actions:**
    * Use data from your project management system to populate the title and body of new GitHub issues or pull requests created by agents.
    * Trigger notifications (via Email or Slack integrations) based on GitHub events like new PRs, merged PRs, or new issues.
    * Log commit activity or release information fetched from GitHub into a Google Sheet or database for reporting and auditing purposes.
