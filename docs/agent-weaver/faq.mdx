## Running Agents

<InfoCallout title="“Run” Does Nothing" collapsible>
**Cause** — This usually happens when the prompt is empty or the model times out.  

**Fix**  
1. Make sure your internet connection is stable.  
2. Keep prompts under 2,000 characters for smoother runs.  
3. Reload the page and retry.  

If issues persist, check if your daily message limit is reached (see [Plan Limits](#plan-limits)).

<InfoCallout title="External API Calls Time Out" collapsible>
**Cause** — Some third-party APIs are slower than Weaver’s default wait time.  

**Fix**  
- Increase the **Maximum Wait Time** setting in the APICall component.  
- For very long-running jobs, switch the workflow to an **Async → Await** pattern so execution can resume once the API responds.

## Debugging Agents

<InfoCallout title="“Fix with AI” Button Is Not Visible" collapsible>
**Cause** — Fix with AI only appears when a component is selected *and* logs show an error.  

**Fix**  
1. Select the failing component with a red border.  
2. Or multi-select with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>.  
3. Run again with Debug Mode enabled.  

See [Debugging with Weaver](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents) for full troubleshooting steps.  
</InfoCallout>

<Spacer size="sm" />

<InfoCallout title="Logs Are Empty" collapsible>
**Cause** — Debug Mode was not enabled.  

**Fix**  
- Toggle **Debug Mode** in the top toolbar **before** pressing Run.  
- Once active, logs will capture inputs, outputs, and errors for every component.  

Read more in [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs).

## Cost and Plan Limits

<InfoCallout title="Plan Limits on Free Accounts" collapsible>
Free plans allow up to **5 messages per day** in Weaver. After that, you’ll need to wait until the next day or upgrade your plan to continue building and testing agents.  

**Tip** — If you hit limits often, move to a paid plan so you can iterate without interruptions.  
See [Billing Management](/docs/account-management/billing-management) for upgrade options.

<InfoCallout title="Agent Consumes Too Many Tokens" collapsible>
**Cause** — Some skills or prompts may be generating unnecessarily long outputs.  

**Fix**  
1. Go to **Analytics → Model Usage** to identify which skill is responsible.  
2. Optimise prompts to keep responses scoped.  
3. Choose lighter models (e.g., GPT-4o mini) when high accuracy is not required.  
4. Add constraints to outputs (e.g., “Return JSON only” or “Limit response to 200 words”).  

See [Best Practices](/docs/agent-weaver/best-practices) for more optimisation tips.

## Using Features

<InfoCallout title="Upload an Image" collapsible>

<InfoCallout title="Select Multiple Components" collapsible>
Hold <kbd>Cmd</kbd> / <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> while clicking each component, **or** drag a selection box starting from an empty space on the Canvas.
