# Export / Import Agents via Postman

Use Postman to test your agent’s API endpoints or import external APIs into your SmythOS builder.

<InfoCallout title="Why use Postman with SmythOS?">
Postman lets you validate, debug, and document your agent’s endpoints using a familiar interface. It also helps streamline external API integration through easy imports.
</InfoCallout>

## Export to Postman

You can export your agent’s API collection to Postman for testing, monitoring, or demoing.

### How to export:

1. Open your agent from the **Team Dashboard**
2. Click the three-dot menu
3. Select **Export to Postman**
4. Choose your environment:

   - **Test Endpoint Collection**  
     Uses the test subdomain for internal testing or development.

   - **Prod Endpoint Collection**  
     Available only after deployment. Uses your production subdomain and is recommended for live agents.

<WarningCallout title="Prod export is only available after deployment">
You must deploy your agent before exporting the production-ready Postman collection.
</WarningCallout>

5. Download the `.json` file
6. Import it into Postman

## Import a Postman Collection

You can bring external APIs into SmythOS by importing Postman collections directly into the builder.

### How to import:

1. Open the **Builder**
2. Drag and drop your Postman `.json` file onto the canvas

<InfoCallout title="What happens next">
Each request in your Postman collection becomes an API Call component, ready for use in agent workflows.
</InfoCallout>

3. SmythOS will:
   - Convert requests into API nodes
   - Preserve methods, headers, payloads, and authentication configs

## Tips and Notes

<TipCallout title="Use descriptive request names">
Before exporting from Postman, name each request clearly. These names become the labels for API components in your SmythOS canvas.
</TipCallout>

- Only JSON Postman collections are supported  
- Version 2.x format is recommended for best results  
- You can edit URLs, headers, and tokens directly inside each imported component
