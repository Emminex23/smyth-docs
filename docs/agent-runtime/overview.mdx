# Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)

<InfoCallout title="The Purpose-Built Runtime for AI Agents in SmythOS">
SRE runs your agents in isolated, observable, zero-trust environments with plug-in connectors for any supported LLM, datastore, or API.
</InfoCallout>

## What is SRE and why does it exist?

The [**Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)**](https://github.com/SmythOS/smyth-runtime/) is the native agent execution engine in **SmythOS**. It provides:

-   Isolated agent runs through a [security model](/docs/agent-runtime/security) using `Candidates`
-   A [`Candidate/ACL` system](/docs/agent-runtime/security) to enforce zero-trust access at runtime
-   Real-time logging and detailed execution traces visible in **Studio**
-   Pluggable [Connectors](/docs/agent-runtime/components) for LLMs, vector DBs, APIs, and more
-   Multi-environment consistency for deployment across cloud, on-prem, and local development

## Why use SRE over generic infrastructure?

Running agents on generic infrastructure (like containers or serverless platforms) means managing:

-   API tokens, auth, and retries manually
-   Logging and tracing from scratch
-   Custom integrations for every service
-   No clear isolation or resource limits per task

SRE handles all of that by design. You define your configuration programmatically or visually in **Studio**; SRE runs, secures, and monitors the execution with features like:

<TipCallout title="Built for AI Agents">
Use SRE to eliminate boilerplate infrastructure code and focus on agent logic.
</TipCallout>

-   Environment consistency across cloud, local, and enterprise
-   Zero-trust runtime enforcement
-   Modular and configurable execution without boilerplate

## What do you get with SRE?

| Area | Containers / Serverless | Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Access control** | Manually coded per app | Enforced per-run via the `Candidate/ACL` system |
| **LLM/API integration** | Custom logic, per model/service | Plug-and-play via programmatic Connectors |
| **Observability** | Needs manual setup | Built-in logs and traces, viewable in **Studio** |
| **Runtime isolation** | Per pod or function | Per agent run (via Candidate security) |
| **Environment parity** | Code changes across dev/prod | Same configuration works everywhere |
| **Execution scaling** | Needs autoscaling config | Managed via **Load Balancing** and **Forked Agents** |

<InfoCallout title="Consistent Across Every Environment">
You can run the same agent with the same logic, config, and security across development, staging, and production.
</InfoCallout>

## How SRE works

Every time your agent runs, SRE uses its [`Candidate/ACL` system](/docs/agent-runtime/security) to create a secure, sandboxed runtime session for that specific execution, operating with zero trust by default.

Each session:
-   Scopes to a single agent and task
-   Enforces its own **memory limits**
-   Uses the `Candidate/ACL` system to determine what it can access
-   Streams prompt and response logs to **Studio** or your observability platform
-   Can run identically in development, staging, or production

## What’s optimized for LLM workflows?

<InfoCallout title="Effortless Model Switching">
Easily switch between models like Claude and GPT-4 with a simple configuration update. SRE handles the model-specific requirements, saving you from rewriting your agent's code and API logic.
</InfoCallout>

SRE is LLM-native, meaning it’s designed to handle AI-specific execution patterns:

-   Optimized request routing and caching
-   Multi-model routing and failover
-   Prompt and response streaming
-   Config-driven switching between LLMs or providers
<Spacer size="md" />

## How do you connect to LLMs, APIs, and databases?

With **[Connectors](/docs/agent-runtime/components)**, which are programmatically configured modules that plug in external services using the **[Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)**.

### Supported connector types with SRE:
| Type | Examples |
| :--- | :--- |
| **LLMs** | `OpenAI`, `Anthropic`, `Google AI`, `AWS Bedrock`, `Groq` |
| **VectorDB**| `Pinecone`, `SmythManaged` |
| **Storage** | `Local`, `S3`, `Smyth` |
| **Observability**| `Console`, `Smyth`, **Studio** |
| **Auth** | `Vault Services` (HashiCorp, AWS) |

<TipCallout title="Swap services with a config change">
You can replace an OpenAI model with an Anthropic model by updating a single line in your SDK configuration.
</TipCallout>
<Spacer size="md" />

## How is the runtime structured?

SRE splits the runtime into two layers, as detailed in the [Architecture](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture) documentation:

| Layer | What It Does | Can You Customize? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Runtime** | Task scheduler, message bus, metrics, quotas | No (versioned core) |
| **Connectors** | LLMs, vector DBs, APIs, auth providers | Yes, programmatically configurable via the SDK |

<WarningCallout title="ACLs Required for Execution">
An agent cannot run unless it has a valid Access Candidate. Access can be managed [programmatically](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) or generated in **Studio**.
</WarningCallout>
<Spacer size="md" />

## Where can you run SRE?
Anywhere you need... SRE supports multiple environments out of the box. See our [Deployment Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/deployment) for more details.

## Is SRE the right choice for you?

### Use SRE if you:

-   Work with LLMs, APIs, or vector stores
-   Need consistent behavior across development and production
-   Want built-in observability and ACL enforcement
-   Care about versioned, auditable agent runs

### SRE might not be for you if:

-   You’re running a traditional backend or monolithic web app
-   You don’t need dynamic or [agent-based execution logic](/docs/agent-runtime/building-agents)
