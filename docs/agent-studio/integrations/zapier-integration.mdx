## Prerequisites

1. **Navigate to Zapier Credentials**: Visit [Zapier Credentials](https://actions.zapier.com/credentials/) and copy the API key
2. **Enter in SmythOS Vault**: Go to the Vault page in `SmythOS` and input the API key, ensuring the scope is set to Zapier
3. **Manage Actions**: Manage your Zapier actions at [Zapier Custom Actions](https://actions.zapier.com/custom/actions/)

## Inputs

The required input varies based on the selected `Zapier` action.

### Instructions Input

Zapier actions typically have an `Instructions` input field. Here's how to use it:

#### Case 1: AI Determines Input Values

1. **Action Fields**: Default to `Have AI guess a value for this field`.
2. **Saving Action**: Save the action with this option selected.
3. **Executing Action**:
   - **Direct Input**: Provide `Document_Name` and `Document_Content` directly, leaving `Instructions` blank.
   - **Using Instructions**: For example, "Create a new document called 'Test' with content 'Hello, how are you.'" Zapier extracts `Document_Name` and `Document_Content` from this instruction.

#### Case 2: Setting Specific Values

1. **Select Specific Value**: Choose `Set a specific value for this field`.
2. **Establish Default Values**: Set default values for the fields in the Zapier action.
3. **Consistent Default Use**: The action will always use these default values, bypassing the `Instructions` field.
