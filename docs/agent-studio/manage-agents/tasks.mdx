## Bulk Runs

Execute multiple tasks simultaneously using your agent's endpoints.

### Single Task Execution
1. Click on the agent card to access the Agent Settings page.
2. Select endpoint and click `Call`
3. Enter input data
4. Click `Call Endpoint`
5. View results

### Bulk Processing
1. Navigate to Agent Settings
2. Click `Bulk Work` on desired endpoint
3. Add data either:
   - ‚Ä¢ Manually via `Add Row`
   - ‚Ä¢ Upload CSV file for multiple entries
4. Execute:
   - ‚Ä¢ Individual rows using `Run`
   - ‚Ä¢ All rows using `Run in Bulk`

> üìã **CSV File Format Requirements**
>
> When uploading a CSV file for bulk operations, you must follow this specific format:
>
> üî§ **First row**: Must contain the names of the inputs that match your endpoint's input parameters
> 
> üìä **Second row onwards**: Contains the actual data to be processed by the endpoint
>
> For example, if your endpoint requires inputs named "query" and "max_results", your CSV should look like:
>
> | query | max_results |
> |-------|-------------|
> | digital marketing trends 2023 | 5 |
> | AI developments healthcare | 10 |
> | sustainable energy innovations | 7 |
> | remote work best practices | 8 |
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Failing to include the proper input names in the first row will result in processing errors, as the system won't be able to match your data with the endpoint's required inputs.
