# Discord Integration

`Discord` is a widely-used communication platform known for its versatility, catering not only to gamers but also to diverse communities and interest groups.

At `SmythOS`, we've seamlessly integrated with `Discord`, providing custom components that make incorporating its powerful services into your agents effortless.

## Send Message

The `Send Message` component simplifies the process of sending messages to channels within Discord servers. With this component, you can efficiently engage with your community, share updates, or automate communication tasks.

### Settings

To initialize this component, follow these steps to obtain your `Bot Token`:

1. Create an `Application` if you don't already have one.
2. Navigate to your `Application Dashboard` and add a new Bot to obtain the `Bot Token`.
3. Input this `Bot Token` into the specified section in the component's settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `Bot Token` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

### Inputs

To effectively utilize this component, provide the following inputs:

1. **channel_id `required<string>`:** The unique identifier of the channel where the message will be sent. You can find the channel ID by right-clicking on the channel name in Discord and selecting "Copy ID."
2. **content `required<string>`:** The content of the message to be sent. This can include text, emojis, and Discord markdown syntax. The maximum length of the message is 2000 characters.

> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs

When this component is executed, it yields the subsequent outputs:

1. **Response**: This output is an object that conveys comprehensive details about the outcome of the operation to send a message. It includes information such as the message ID, timestamp, and other pertinent details.
2. **Headers**: It comes with the HTTP headers that were part of the `Discord` server's response, adding extra metadata including response status codes and content type.
3. **messageId**: This straightforwardly indicates the ID of the message that was sent.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.
