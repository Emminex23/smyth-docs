# Google Calendar Integration

`Google Calendar` is a widely-used scheduling and time-management tool that helps individuals and organizations organize their appointments, meetings, and daily activities efficiently. Its integration into `SmythOS` provides seamless synchronization of events and schedules across different platforms, enhancing productivity and ensuring consistent communication.

By incorporating `Google Calendar`, `SmythOS` ensures users can easily connect their calendars, view upcoming events, and even automate event creation based on system actions, providing a holistic and unified approach to time management within the ecosystem.

#### Client ID & Client Secret

For a visual step-by-step guide, watch this [video](#google-oauth-setup).

To effectively integrate `Google Calendar` with `SmythOS`, acquiring secure credentials such as `Client ID` and `Client Secret` is essential. Below is a comprehensive guide on obtaining these credentials:

1. **Visit the Google Developers Console**:
   - Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Either start a new project or choose an existing one that suits your requirements.

2. **Enable the Google Calendar API**:
   - In the Developers Console, head over to the `Library` section.
   - Search for the `Google Calendar API` and enable it for your chosen project.

3. **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Fill out the necessary information on the consent screen settings, including your application's name, email, and the scopes needed for operation.

4. **Create Credentials**:
   - Navigate to the `Credentials` tab.
   - Select `Create credentials` and then opt for `OAuth client ID`.
   - Specify the type of application, add required redirect URIs, and ensure to configure the credential details properly.
   - Crucially, set the callback URL as `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback` to facilitate correct redirection after authentication.

5. **Retrieve Client ID and Client Secret**:
   - Post the setup of your OAuth client ID, you will receive your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, which are crucial for the next steps.
