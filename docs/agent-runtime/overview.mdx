# Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)

<InfoCallout title="Purpose-built runtime for AI agents">
SRE runs your agents in isolated, observable, zero-trust environments with plug-in connectors for any LLM, datastore, or API.
</InfoCallout>

## What is SRE and why does it exist?

The [**Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)**](https://github.com/SmythOS/smyth-runtime/) is the native agent execution engine in SmythOS. It provides:

- Sandboxed agent instances, called **Candidates**, with per-task resource limits
- Signed **ACLs** to enforce zero-trust access at runtime
- Real-time logging and trace replay for every execution
- Plug-and-play **Connectors** for LLMs, vector DBs, APIs, and more
- Multi-environment consistency for deployment across cloud, on-prem, and local dev

## Why use SRE over containers or serverless?

Running agents on generic infrastructure (like containers or serverless platforms) means managing:

- API tokens, auth, and retries manually  
- Logging and tracing from scratch  
- Custom integrations for every service  
- No clear isolation or resource limits per task

SRE handles all of that, by design. You define config; SRE runs, secures, and monitors the execution with features like:

Use SRE to eliminate boilerplate infrastructure code and focus on agent logic.
</TipCallout>

- Environment consistency across cloud, local, and enterprise
- Zero-trust runtime enforcement
- Modular and configurable execution without boilerplate

## What do you get with SRE? 

| Area                  | Containers / Serverless                | Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Access control**      | Manually coded per app                 | Enforced per-run via signed ACLs          |
| **LLM/API integration** | Custom logic, per model/service        | Plug-and-play via YAML connectors         |
| **Observability**       | Needs manual setup                     | Built-in logs, traces, and replay         |
| **Runtime isolation**   | Per pod or function                    | Per agent run (Candidate)                 |
| **Environment parity**  | Code changes across dev/prod           | Same config works everywhere              |
| **Execution scaling**   | Needs autoscaling config               | Automatic scheduling across runs          |

<InfoCallout title="Consistent across every environment">
You can run the same agent run with the same logic, config, and security across dev, staging, and prod.
</InfoCallout>

## How SRE works

Every time your agent runs, SRE creates a **Candidate**, a sandboxed runtime session for that specific execution with zero trust by default. 

Each Candidate:

- Scopes to a single agent and task
- Enforces its own CPU/GPU/memory limits  
- Uses a **signed ACL** to determine what it can access  
- Streams prompt + response logs to Studio or your observability platform  
- Can run identically in dev, staging, or production

## What’s optimized for LLM workflows?

<InfoCallout title="Use it like an LLM router">
Route tasks between models (e.g., Claude vs GPT-4) based on price, latency, or task type — all in YAML.
</InfoCallout>

SRE is LLM-native... meaning it’s designed to handle AI-specific execution patterns:

- Token- and latency-aware scheduling
- Multi-model routing and failover
- Prompt + response streaming
- Cost-based fallback logic
- Config-driven switching between LLMs or providers
<Spacer size="md" />

## How do you connect to LLMs, APIs, and databases?

With **Connectors**, YAML-defined modules that plug in external services.  
No SDKs or manual configs needed.

### Supported connector types with SRE:

| Type            | Examples                         | Controlled In Config |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **LLMs**        | OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama        | `llm:` block          |
| **Vector Stores**| Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant      | `storage:` block      |
| **Observability**| Studio, Datadog, LogSinks       | `logs:` + `traces:`   |
| **Auth Providers**| Auth0, Cognito, JWT            | `auth:` block         |

<TipCallout title="Swap services with a config change">
You can replace OpenAI with Claude or a local LLM by updating a single line in your connector config.
</TipCallout>

## How is the runtime structured?

SRE splits the runtime into two layers:

| Layer            | What It Does                                | Can You Customize? |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Core Runtime** | Task scheduler, message bus, metrics, quotas | No (versioned core) |
| **Connectors**   | LLMs, vector DBs, APIs, auth providers       | Yes, YAML-configurable |

<WarningCallout title="ACLs required for execution">
An agent cannot run unless it includes a valid, signed Access Control List.  
Define ACLs in YAML or generate them in [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview).
</WarningCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Where can you run SRE?
Anywhere you need... SRE supports multiple environments out of the box:

<Tabs
  tabs={[
    { label: 'Cloud', content: (
        <>
          <p>Push your YAML config to Smyth Cloud and start agents with Studio tracing enabled.</p>
        </>
      )
    },
    { label: 'Kubernetes', content: (
        <>
          <p>Deploy the SRE Helm chart and manage via GitOps or Studio in your cluster.</p>
        </>
      )
    },
    { label: 'Local Dev', content: (
        <>
          <p>Run <code>sre dev</code> or Docker Compose for local iteration with full logs and trace.</p>
        </>
      )
    }
  ]}
/>

## Is SRE the right runtime for your agents?

### Use SRE if you:

- Work with LLMs, APIs, or vector stores
- Need consistent behavior across dev and prod
- Want built-in observability and ACL enforcement
- Care about versioned, auditable agent runs

### SRE might not be for you if:

- You’re running a traditional backend or monolithic web app
- You don’t need dynamic or agent-based execution logic
