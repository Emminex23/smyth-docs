# Deployment with SRE

SRE supports a flexible deployment lifecycle ranging from local development to a fully-managed cloud platform and large-scale enterprise environments.

<InfoCallout title="What this covers">
How the runtime initializes, what environments you can deploy to, and how each option supports your workflow.
</InfoCallout>

## How SRE Starts Up

Each time SRE runs, it follows a consistent boot process. This lets you configure it once and scale confidently from development to production.

### Boot Sequence Steps

The reference [architecture](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture) follows this general sequence:
1.  Initialize core services: storage, cache, vault, logging
2.  Register the agent manager and load available [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components)
3.  Set up HTTP endpoints and routing, if applicable
4.  Connect to configured LLM providers and vector databases
5.  Load account and access control configuration
6.  Signal readiness... your agents can now run

```bash
// Example: Initialize SRE for a production-like environment
import { SRE } from 'smyth-runtime';

const sre = SRE.init({
  Storage: { Connector: 'S3', Settings: { bucket: 'my-bucket' } },
  Cache: { Connector: 'Redis', Settings: { url: 'redis://prod-cluster' } },
  Vault: { Connector: 'HashicorpVault', Settings: { url: 'https://vault.company.com' } },
  LLM: { Connector: 'OpenAI', Settings: { apiKey: '...' } },
});

await sre.ready();
```

## Deployment Environments

SRE offers several deployment options to fit your needs, from quick prototypes to scalable, secure production systems.

| Mode | Infrastructure | Common Use Case | How to Access |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Agent Cloud** | **SmythOS-managed** | Production, Staging, MVPs | Via **Studio** |
| **Local Runtime** | Your own device (Docker possible)| Debugging, Local Dev | SDK / Docker |
| **Self-Hosted** | Your private infra | Enterprise, Regulated Workloads | Custom Deployment |

## Agent Cloud Deployment

This is the fully-managed hosting option provided by SmythOS. It's the fastest way to get a production-ready agent online.

### Benefits
- Auto-scaling infrastructure with HTTPS
- Zero-setup, managed environment
- Centralized logs and traces in **[Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)**
- Continuous deployment from Studio

### Steps to deploy
1.  Open your agent in **Studio**.
2.  Click the **Deploy** button.
3.  Select the **Agent Cloud** target.
4.  Set your agent version and release notes.
5.  Click **Deploy**.

<InfoCallout title="Use a custom subdomain">
You can map your own subdomain to your Agent Cloud deployment in your account settings.

## Local Development Setup

Running SRE on your own machine is ideal for debugging, testing complex workflows, or building agents offline. The standard [Getting Started](/docs/agent-runtime/getting-started) guide uses a local setup by default.

- Run directly from code using the **[SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)**
- Use simple connectors like `RAM` for cache and `Local` for storage
- Get immediate feedback with logs streamed to your console

## Self-Hosted & Enterprise

For maximum control and scale, you can run SRE inside your own infrastructure (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure). This involves running the SRE process on your servers or containers and configuring it to use production-grade connectors for databases, caches, and secrets management.
