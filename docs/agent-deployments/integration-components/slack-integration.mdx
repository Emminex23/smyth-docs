# Use Slack with SmythOS

> Connect your agents to Slack for real-time notifications, conversations, and seamless team collaboration.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Authenticate your Slack app, configure the Send Message component, and optionally deploy via [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp) to enable broader integration options.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Integrate Slack?

Slack is the communication layer for modern teams. By integrating it into your SmythOS agent, you can:

- Send alerts or summaries directly to teams
- Automatically post updates from workflows
- Build chatOps flows for faster task execution
- Route responses from AI agents into Slack threads
- Customize interactions based on channel, user, or context

With both direct Slack component integration **and** Model Context Protocol (MCP), you can choose how and where Slack fits in.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Slack integration, ensure you have:

- A Slack Workspace
- A Slack App with the Bot User enabled
- Your **Bot User OAuth Token**
- Optional: A [Vault](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/vault-sharing) secret setup to store your token

<Divider />

## Option 1: Use the Slack Component

### Step 1: Get Your Bot Token

1. Create a Slack App at [Slack API Console](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Enable the Bot User feature
3. Go to **OAuth & Permissions**, install the app to your workspace
4. Copy your **Bot User OAuth Token**
5. Add it to the component settings manually or via [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/vault-sharing)

### Step 2: Configure `Send Message`

- Open your Slack **Send Message** component
- Add your Bot Token from Vault or directly into the settings

### Step 3: Inputs

```json
{
  "channel_id": "C12345678",
  "text": "Your agent has completed the task."
}
```

Required inputs:

- `channel_id`: ID of the Slack channel to send messages to
- `text`: Content of the message (up to 2000 characters)

### Step 4: Outputs

Once the component runs, you get:

- `response`: Full message object
- `headers`: HTTP response metadata
- `status`: Request status
- `msgObj`: Message details (ID, content, timestamp)

These outputs can be logged, forwarded, or used in logic branches.

<Divider />

## Option 2: Deploy via Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Want to connect Slack using broader context-aware workflows?
Use [Deploy as MCP](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-mcp) to:

- Integrate Slack within multi-channel logic
- Trigger responses based on agent memory or role context
- Connect Slack alongside other channels (e.g., Discord, email)

This is ideal for:

- Multi-agent collaboration across channels
- Domain-specific response routing
- Embedding Slack workflows into long-running task agents

<InfoCallout>
Use the Slack component as an output layer inside your MCP tree to send messages post-processing.
</InfoCallout>

## What’s Next?

- Monitor usage or delivery via [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/agent-settigns/logs)
- Create dynamic message content from user inputs or API calls
- Trigger Slack messages when data changes using conditionals
- Combine with the [Webhook Trigger](/docs/agents/builder/component-triggers) to notify Slack in real-time
- Route Slack responses back into SmythOS using slash commands or event triggers (coming soon)

# Use Slack with SmythOS

> Engage teams directly through Slack by sending messages from your SmythOS agent using either direct components or the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Use your Bot OAuth Token to send messages to Slack channels with either built-in components or through the MCP server deployment.
</InfoCallout>

<Divider />

## Why Integrate Slack?

Slack remains one of the most widely adopted team collaboration platforms. With SmythOS, you can:

- Trigger Slack messages from conditional workflows
- Send updates to internal teams directly from an agent
- Integrate with workflows like approval chains, alerts, and chatbot feedback
- Deploy your Slack integration through MCP for a structured context-aware agent

<Divider />

## Two Ways to Connect

You can connect to Slack using:

1. **Direct Component Integration**
2. **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server Deployment**

<Divider />

## Option 1: Direct Component Integration

### Step 1: Get Your Slack OAuth Token

1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) and create a new app
2. Under **OAuth & Permissions**, install the app to your workspace
3. Copy the **Bot User OAuth Token**

<InfoCallout>
Store your token securely in [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/vault-sharing).
</InfoCallout>

### Step 2: Add and Configure the Component

Use the **Send Message** component.

**Settings:**
- Bot User OAuth Token (via Vault)

**Inputs:**
```json
{
  "channel_id": "C024BE91L",
  "text": "New incident reported via SmythOS."
}
```

**Outputs:**
- **response**: Full server response
- **status**: Success or error status
- **headers**: HTTP headers
- **msgObj**: Slack message metadata

<Divider />

## Option 2: Deploy via MCP to Slack

MCP lets you define a structured, event-driven deployment where Slack acts as a receiver or notifier.

**Use Cases:**
- Route chat messages to Slack after context-aware analysis
- Convert chat summary into Slack team digest
- Deliver task completions or errors as formatted Slack messages

### Requirements

- Valid Bot Token with messaging permissions
- Agent deployed with an MCP-compatible endpoint

### Sample Flow

```json
{
  "input": "New ticket submitted in the support queue.",
  "channel_id": "C0XYZ123",
  "platform": "slack"
}
```

Use this format in your MCP server and route output to a `Send Message` component.

## What’s Next?

- Attach this to a [Chatbot Interface](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatbot) for multi-platform updates
- Use [Vault](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/vault-sharing) to manage credentials across agents
- Monitor messaging activity in [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/agent-settings/logs)
