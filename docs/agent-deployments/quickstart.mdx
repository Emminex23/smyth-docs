# Quickstart to Deployment

This quickstart shows you how to publish an agent to **Agent Cloud**, the default runtime hosted by SmythOS.  
In just a few clicks you’ll have a live HTTPS URL with versioning and autoscaling built in.

<InfoCallout title="Other deployment options"> 
You can also deploy to **Enterprise** (on-prem or VPC) or **Local Runtime** (offline/local dev). See the [Deployments Overview](/docs/agent-deployments/overview) for details.
</InfoCallout>

## Step 1: Open and Deploy

Open your agent in [**Studio**](/docs/agent-studio/overview). Click **Deploy** in the top right.  

The **Deployment panel** appears with **Agent Cloud** already selected.

## Step 2: Configure Your Deployment

In the panel, set the key details:

- **Version number**: Enter Major.Minor (for example `1.0`, `1.1`, `2.0`).  
  Each deployment must be unique. See the [Versioning Guide](/docs/agent-deployments/versioning) if unsure.  
- **Subdomain**: Use the default SmythOS URL or [set up your own domain](/docs/agent-deployments/subdomains).  
- **Release notes (optional)**: Add a short summary of what changed, like `Adds PDF export` or `Fixes Slack formatting`.  

<WarningCallout title="Versioning rules">
Once published, a version is immutable. You can always create a new version, but you can’t overwrite an existing one.
</WarningCallout>

## Step 3: Publish Your Agent

Click **Deploy**. SmythOS will:  

- Assign your version number  
- Provision your subdomain and SSL  
- Run health checks  

When it’s ready, you’ll see your live agent URL.

## What You Get

<TipCallout title="Immutable deployments">
Every deployment is locked to its version. Rollback and history tracking are automatic.
</TipCallout>

- A secure HTTPS URL you can share immediately  
- A record of deployments in **Studio → Agent Settings → Deployments**  
- Preserved history for auditing and rollback  

<Spacer size="md" />

## Troubleshooting

<WarningCallout title="If your URL doesn’t load">
- Wait 1–2 minutes for SSL provisioning  
- Refresh or test in a private window  
- Confirm your version number is unique  
- For custom domains, make sure DNS changes have propagated (see [Subdomains Guide](/docs/agent-deployments/subdomains))
