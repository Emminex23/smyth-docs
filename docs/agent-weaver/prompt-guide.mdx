# Prompt Engineering with Weaver

Weaver can assemble a workflow from almost any instruction. But if you give it a vague prompt, it will ask follow-up questions and slow you down. If you give it a **clear, structured prompt**, Weaver has everything it needs to build the agent immediately with no follow-up questions.

<InfoCallout title="The Golden Rule">
Write every prompt with **Goal → Inputs → Skills → Outputs → Constraints**.  
That structure gives Weaver complete context and reduces back-and-forth.
</InfoCallout>

## 1. Why Prompt Engineering Matters

Prompts are the blueprint Weaver uses to create workflows. Clear prompts produce modular, testable agents that run correctly on the first try. Ambiguous prompts create guesswork and messy flows.

If you want ready-made examples, see the [Prompt Library](/docs/agent-weaver/prompt-library). This page teaches you how to write prompts yourself.

## 2. The Standard Prompt Structure

Every strong Weaver prompt includes these five sections:

<PromptCard
  title="Prompt Template"
  tags={['Template']}
  prompt={`Goal: [Outcome in one clear sentence]

Inputs:
- [Required user inputs]
- [Optional inputs if needed]

Skills:
1. [Actionable step 1]
2. [Actionable step 2]
3. [Actionable step 3]

Outputs:
- [Exact format: JSON schema, Markdown, table, file]

Constraints:
- [Word limits, item caps, tone, audience]
- [Formatting rules or compliance needs]`}
/>

When you provide all five sections, Weaver has no missing context and it builds the agent right away instead of asking questions.

## 3. Writing Effective Prompts

### Be Specific with Goals
<PromptCard
  title="Clear vs Vague Goals"
  tags={['Goals']}
  prompt={`❌ Vague: "Write about Kyoto."
✅ Clear: "Draft a 600-word blog about Kyoto with three sections: food, culture, and transport."`}
/>

### Break Work into Skills
<PromptCard
  title="Skills Example"
  tags={['Skills']}
  prompt={`Goal: Weekly sales digest

Skills:
1. Fetch weekly_sales.csv from S3
2. Summarise data into 5 bullet points
3. Generate bar chart PNG
4. Email digest to sales@acme.com`}
/>

### Define Outputs and Constraints
<PromptCard
  title="Constrain the Output"
  tags={['Constraints']}
  prompt={`Goal: Create a 5-minute finance podcast script.

Skills:
1. Gather 3 finance stories
2. Write intro, 3 sections, and a closing
3. Add one host aside per story

Outputs:
- Markdown with sections: Intro, Story 1, Story 2, Story 3, Closing

Constraints:
- Max 700 words
- Conversational tone
- Exclude stock tips`}
/>

## 4. Advanced Prompt Techniques

### Add Modifiers
Use constraints to sharpen results.

<PromptCard
  title="Modifier Example"
  tags={['Advanced']}
  prompt={`Goal: Write a one-page product brief.

Inputs:
- product_name
- competitor_names[]

Skills:
1. Research competitors
2. Summarise positioning
3. Write product brief

Outputs:
- Markdown with headings

Constraints:
- Limit to 350 words
- Reading level: Year 9
- Include at least 3 reference links`}
/>

### Few-Shot Anchors
Show Weaver the format you want by including one example.

<PromptCard
  title="Few-Shot Example"
  tags={['Style']}
  prompt={`Goal: Generate a 120-word LinkedIn post.

Skills:
1. Capture one clear benefit
2. Add two use cases
3. End with a question

Constraints:
- Professional but warm tone
- 120 words max

Example to follow:
"We reduced CSV import time by 70%. Teams can now clean data and build reports in one session. What would you import first?"`}
/>

### Multimodal Prompts
Weaver can parse URLs and images directly.

<PromptCard
  title="URL Input Example"
  tags={['Multimodal']}
  prompt={`Goal: Convert a blog post into a help guide.

Inputs:
- blog_url: string

Skills:
1. Read the blog content at {blog_url}
2. Extract step-by-step instructions
3. Rewrite as a numbered help guide

Outputs:
- Markdown with H2 headings and steps

Constraints:
- Preserve technical terms from the source`}
/>

<PromptCard
  title="Diagram Input Example"
  tags={['Multimodal']}
  prompt={`Goal: Build an agent from a workflow diagram.

Inputs:
- diagram_file: PNG or SVG

Skills:
1. Parse the diagram
2. Identify components and connections
3. Recreate the workflow in Canvas

Outputs:
- Complete wired agent

Constraints:
- Use labels from the diagram as component names`}
/>

## 5. Debugging and Iteration

When results are off, refine the prompt rather than rewriting the entire agent.

<PromptCard
  title="Refinement Example"
  tags={['Debugging']}
  prompt={`The summary was too long. Limit it to 150 words. Format as bullet points only.`}
/>

<PromptCard
  title="Schema Example"
  tags={['Debugging']}
  prompt={`Return JSON with these keys only: title, slug, summary, keywords[]. No other keys. Missing values = null.`}
/>

For full troubleshooting, see [Debugging with Weaver](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents).

## 6. Common Mistakes and Fixes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | What To Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| Vague goal | Weaver lacks context and asks follow-ups | State a measurable outcome in one sentence |
| One giant skill | Hard to test or debug | Break into 3–5 numbered steps |
| Missing constraints | Outputs sprawl or vary | Specify format, tone, and limits |
| Unlimited output | Token waste and errors | Add caps (e.g., 200 words, 5 bullets) |
| Ambiguous tone | Wrong style or locale | Define audience, tone, and language (e.g., UK English) |
