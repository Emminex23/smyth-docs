# Self-Hosted Studio with Docker

<InfoCallout title="What you will learn">
  By the end of this guide, you will know what self-hosting gives you, the required setup, available installation paths, and how to troubleshoot common issues.
</InfoCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Whatâ€™s Included

Self-hosting gives you the **Studio** experience on your own machine or server, including:

- Visual Canvas for building agents  
- Built-in authentication, Vault, and environment variable management  
- Debug, Inspect, and run history  

<TipCallout title="Is this for you?">
  This setup is ideal if you can run Docker on your machine and want full control, privacy, and a simple install path.
</TipCallout>

## System Requirements

Before starting, make sure your environment meets these minimums:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and Docker Compose v2
- At least 4 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM recommended
- A MySQL compatible database (local or managed)

<InfoCallout title="Start simple">
  Start locally with Docker. You can add a reverse proxy and HTTPS later to share access securely.
</InfoCallout>

## Quickstart


## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio.git
cd smythos-studio
```

<Spacer size="md" />

## 2. Create Your Environment File

```bash
cp .env.compose.example .env
```

Open `.env` and set at minimum:

```text
DATABASE_URL="mysql://user:pass@db:3306/smythos"
APP_BASE_URL="http://localhost"
SESSION_SECRET="long-random-string"
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key" # optional
```

<Spacer size="md" />

## 3. Start the Stack
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Optional: Watch logs to see services start

```bash
docker compose logs -f
 ```

When services are healthy, open:

```bash
http://localhost
```
You should see the Studio page. Create your first agent and run a quick test.

## Troubleshooting

**Port already in use**  
Stop the conflicting service or change the published ports in Compose.

**Cannot connect to database**  
Check `DATABASE_URL`. Ensure the DB is running and accessible.

**Blank UI or 502 error**  
Review container logs for middleware or runtime errors. Fix `.env` or networking issues, then restart.

**Login loop**  
Confirm `APP_BASE_URL` matches the actual URL and that proxies forward headers correctly.

<InfoCallout title="Logs">
  Use `docker compose logs -f` to watch services start and catch errors early.
</InfoCallout>

## FAQ

**Can I run this on a laptop?**  
Yes. It's completly private to your device when you run it locally using Docker.

**Do I need a public domain?**  
No. Local setups work without a domain. For shared access, add a reverse proxy and HTTPS.

**Is Community the same as Cloud?**  
Community focuses on self-hosting. Some features differ from the cloud version.

**Where can I get help?**  
Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio) or join the community discussions.
