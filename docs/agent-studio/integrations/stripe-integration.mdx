# Stripe Integration

`Stripe` is a technology company that provides payment processing software and APIs for online businesses. It allows businesses to accept payments over the internet, manage subscriptions, handle payouts, and more. `Stripe`'s platform is known for its ease of use, flexibility, and robust set of features. 

At `SmythOS`, we prioritize seamless integration with `Stripe`, enriching its robust features with tailor-made components to streamline integration within your agents' workflow.

## Create Customer

Initiate the creation of a customer using the `Create Customer` component.

### Settings

#### API Secret

To initialize and configure the `Create Customer` component, follow these simple guidelines:

1. If you haven't already, register for an account on the `Stripe` platform to access its payment processing features.
2. Navigate to the [Developers - API Keys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys) section in your Stripe dashboard.
3. Generate your `API Secret` key by following the provided instructions.
4. Return to the settings of the component and input your generated `API Secret` into the specified section designated for API integration.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Secret` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

#### Body

By default, this field contains a sample payload schema for creating a customer. The example serves as a guideline for the required structure and data needed to successfully create a customer record. Please note that this field is editable, enabling you to modify the payload to meet the specific requirements of your request.

### Inputs

To make full use of the `Create Customer` component, it is essential to supply the following input parameter:

1. **trigger `required<any value>`:** This parameter accepts any value and serves as the initiation point for the component's execution. It must be provided to start the process of creating a customer.

> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs

When the `Create Customer` component is executed successfully, you can expect to receive the following outputs:

1. **Response:** This is an object that includes extensive information about the customer that has just been created. It encapsulates details such as the customer's identification number, the associated payment methods, contact information, and any relevant metadata.
2. **Headers:** These are the HTTP headers retrieved from the server's response provided by `Stripe`. They contain additional metadata such as response status codes, which help determine the success of the operation, along with the content type of the response.
3. **customerId:** A unique identifier allocated by `Stripe` for the customer that has been created. This identifier is essential for any future interactions with the customer's record, such as retrieving, updating, or deleting customer information.
