# Marketing Amplifier Agent

The **Marketing Amplifier Agent** automates the entire **content creation and multi-channel distribution lifecycle** through two integrated workflows, eliminating manual bottlenecks from drafting to publishing.

The agent performs two core functions:

1.  **Content Generation & Publishing:** Generates WordPress articles using **GPT-5**, selects categories/SEO metadata, finds Pexels images, creates **draft posts** with media, and sends **Gmail notifications** for review.
2.  **Social Amplification:** Amplifies published posts by creating social media teasers, fetching engaging images, and distributing content across multiple platforms via **Ayrshare integration**.

<InfoCallout title="Why use this agent?">
This agent is a complete content-to-distribution solution. It drastically reduces content production cycles, ensures consistent quality, and maximizes the reach of every piece of content with minimal manual effort.
