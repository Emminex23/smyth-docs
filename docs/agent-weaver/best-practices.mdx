# Best Practices

Well-designed agents are easier to build, maintain, and extend in **Weaver**. Adopting smart habits saves debugging time, avoids runaway token costs, and keeps your workflows reliable in production.

<InfoCallout title="Quick Rule of Thumb">
Start small → Test often → Deploy in stages. These three practices cover most problems before they happen.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Best Practices Matter

Every extra token consumed is a cost, and every hidden bug becomes harder to track down later. By following best practices, you’ll spend less time firefighting and more time building agents that work as expected.

## 1. Build and Test Habits

- **Add One Skill at a Time**: If something fails, you instantly know the source.  
- **Test Early with Debug Mode**: Keep Debug Mode active until all blocks run green. Learn more about enabling it in the [Weaver Interface](/docs/agent-weaver/weaver-ui).  
- **Rerun in Sections**: Use multi-select to rerun parts of a workflow without restarting the whole build.  
- **Deploy in Stages**: Push to staging or a dev endpoint first. A small break in staging is easier to catch than in production.

## 2. Design Modular Workflows

Breaking complex goals into small, focused skills makes agents easier to debug and extend.  

- **One Skill, One Purpose**: Keep tasks specific. For example, one block to “Extract Keywords” and another to “Summarise Text.”  
- **Use Ordered Lists in Prompts**: Weaver parses numbered lists cleanly, which helps it generate modular plans.  
- **Remix Instead of Rebuild**: Adapt from the [Prompt Library](/docs/agent-weaver/prompt-library) or clone a working agent and adjust only what you need.  

<TipCallout title="Why Modularity Helps">
If one block breaks, you fix that block, not the agent. This makes testing and iteration far faster.
</TipCallout>

## 3. Naming and Consistency

Consistent names help teammates and your future self understand workflows quickly.

| Item | Naming Pattern | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **Agent** | Verb + Outcome | `Generate SEO Article` |
| **Skill** | Action + Object | `Extract Keywords` |
| **Inputs** | `snake_case` | `max_results` |

## 4. Manage Performance and Cost

Efficient agents are cheaper and faster to run.  

| Optimise | How |
|----------|-----|
| **Choose models wisely** | Use GPT-4o mini for most steps; reserve full GPT-4o for complex reasoning. |
| **Control loops** | Insert a [Sleep component](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/sleep) in loops to avoid rate limits. |
| **Scope prompts** | Constrain outputs with instructions like “Return JSON only” or “Limit to 200 words.” |

<InfoCallout title="Pro Tip">
Benchmark your workflow with both small and large models to compare cost against accuracy before scaling.
</InfoCallout>

## 5. Prevent Errors and Debug Smarter

- **Inspect Inputs and Outputs** regularly to catch miswired or malformed data.  
- **Apply Fix with AI** when components fail, you can read [Debugging with Weaver](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents) for step-by-step guidance.  
- **Maintain Test Inputs**: Keep a small set of real-world test prompts you can reuse when iterating.  
- **Watch Status Colours**: Green = working, Yellow = waiting, Red = failed. These act as a live error map.

## 6. Deploy with Confidence

- **Stage First, Then Production**: Always test in a staging environment before exposing agents to end users.  
- **Log and Monitor**: Use [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs) to review execution history and spot slow or failing steps.  
- **Rollback Timeline**: If a recent change introduces instability, use rollback to return to the last working version.  

<WarningCallout title="Avoid Hotfix Fatigue">
Skipping staging and pushing straight to production often doubles your debugging workload. Always test safely first.
