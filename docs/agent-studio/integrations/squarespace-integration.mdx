  <summary>Why Integrate Squarespace with Your Agent?</summary>

Your Squarespace store is the heart of your e-commerce business. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that automate your operations, saving you time and reducing manual errors.

- **Automated Inventory Management:** Create agents that sync your Squarespace inventory with an external supplier's stock levels, preventing overselling and ensuring your product availability is always accurate.
- **Streamlined Order Fulfillment:** When a new order is placed, an agent can automatically retrieve the order details and send them to your shipping provider or fulfillment center's API.
- **Dynamic Product Catalogs:** Build agents that can create or update products in your Squarespace store based on data from a spreadsheet, a PIM (Product Information Management) system, or another database.
- **Custom Reporting:** Schedule agents to fetch all order or transaction data daily and format it into a custom report, giving you insights that go beyond the standard Squarespace analytics.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Squarespace account** on a Business plan or higher.
- A Squarespace **API Key** with the necessary permissions.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Squarespace

The connection between SmythOS and Squarespace is configured using a secure API Key.

### Step 1: Get Your Squarespace API Key
1.  Log in to your [Squarespace Dashboard](https://account.squarespace.com/) and select the site you want to connect.
2.  In the main menu, go to **Settings** > **Developer Tools**.
3.  Click on **Developer API Keys**.
4.  Click **Generate Key**.
5.  Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "SmythOS Agent").
6.  Under **Permissions**, check the scopes your agent will need (e.g., `Products: Read and Write`, `Orders: Read and Write`).
7.  Click **Generate Key**.
8.  **Copy the generated API Key immediately.** It will not be shown again.

### Step 2: Store Your API Key in SmythOS Vault
Your API Key is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Squarespace API Key as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `squarespace_api_key`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a Squarespace Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Squarespace component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Key` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `squarespace_api_key`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Key from the Vault to **each** Squarespace component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Squarespace API key in the SmythOS `Vault`. If a key is compromised, generate a new one in Squarespace and update your Vault secret.
* **Grant Specific Permissions:** When generating your API key in Squarespace, grant only the permissions your agent needs. If an agent only reads orders, don't give it write access to products.
* **Understand the Data Hierarchy:** Remember the structure: a `Product` contains one or more `Variants`, and `Inventory` is tracked at the `Variant` level. You often need to get a product's variants first to find the correct `variantId` to update.
* **Use the `Body` for Updates:** For the `Update Product` and `Update Product Variant` components, you must construct the JSON payload in the `Body` setting. Refer to the Squarespace Developer documentation for the correct schema for each object.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, has been revoked, or lacks the necessary permissions for the requested action.
  * **Solution:** Verify your API Key is correct in the SmythOS Vault. In your Squarespace settings, check that the key is active and has the required scopes (e.g., `Products: Read and Write`).

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** An incorrect `productId`, `variantId`, or `orderId` was provided.
  * **Solution:** Double-check all IDs for typos. Ensure the item you are trying to access exists in your store.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request`**
  * **Cause:** The JSON `Body` payload for an update or create operation is malformed or missing required fields.
  * **Solution:** Carefully check your JSON structure against the official Squarespace API documentation. Ensure all required fields are present and data types are correct.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful e-commerce automations with the **SmythOS Squarespace Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as an inventory sync engine. It checks stock levels from a supplier's API and uses the `Increase/Decrease Stock Quantity` components to keep your Squarespace store perfectly in sync.
    * Automates order fulfillment. When a new order is retrieved with `Get All Orders`, the agent sends the customer and shipping details to your shipping provider's API.
    * Creates products from a spreadsheet. The agent reads product data from a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration), then uses `Create Product` and `Upload Product Image` to populate your store.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * When a new order is placed, send a confirmation to the customer using [Resend](/docs/integrations/resend-integration) and post a "New Sale!" notification in a [Discord](/docs/integrations/discord) channel.
    * Use an [LLM component](/docs/integrations/openrouter) to write a product description, then use the `Update Product` component to add it to your store.
    * Log all new orders to a [Firestore](/docs/integrations/firestore-integration) database for long-term analysis and custom reporting.
