# Building Workflows

A **workflow** in SmythOS is a modular chain of components that defines how your agent processes data, connects to services, and performs actions. Workflows can be triggered by chat, API calls, schedules, or other interfaces—giving you a flexible way to automate anything from lead enrichment to document parsing.

Workflows are reusable, configurable, and composable. To make them usable by agents, you connect them using an [Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill), which serves as an entry point.

## How Workflows Work

Each workflow is made up of [components](/docs/agent-studio/components/overview) that each do one thing well. These include logic operators, API calls, LLMs, file processors, and data transformers. You can:

- Fetch data from external systems using [API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/api-output) or scraping components
- Apply logic and conditional branching using control components
- Pass data between steps with fully configurable inputs and outputs

You build and arrange these components visually using the [Studio Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas), which lets you drag, connect, configure, and test as you go.

## Building a Workflow

To create a workflow in SmythOS:

1. Open a new agent or edit an existing one using the Studio Canvas  
2. Add an [Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill) component—this marks the start of a workflow  
3. Add other components from the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components/overview) based on your use case  
4. Define input/output connections and configure each component
5. Test the full skill using **Form Preview**, or run step-by-step using [Debugging Tools](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging)

Use modular skills and break logic into manageable paths. You can reuse subflows or create templates for similar operations.

## How Workflows Are Triggered

Workflows can run in three primary ways, depending on how you want to use them.

### [API Call](/docs/agent-studio/componenets/advanced/api-call)

Each workflow is exposed as a REST API endpoint. You can call it directly from your own applications or scripts.

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.smythos.com/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/startTrigger?apiKey=$SMYTH_WORKFLOW_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"orderId":1234,"amount":49.99}'
```

This is useful for server-to-server automation, webhooks, or backend workflows.

### Agent Invocation

If your workflow is linked to an agent using the [Agent Skill component](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill), the agent can invoke it in response to a user prompt, a chat message, or other agent-triggered events like voice input or UI interactions.

This is the primary way agents turn inputs into structured behaviors.

### Task Invocation

Workflows can also run automatically using [Scheduled Tasks](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/tasks) or [Bulk Processing](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/tasks#bulk-operations). This helps automate repetitive actions such as daily reporting, data fetching, or routine batch jobs.

## Structuring Workflows: Flow Types

SmythOS supports multiple control flow patterns:

- **Sequential Flow**: Components run one after the other
- **Branching Flow**: Logic determines which branch to execute next
- **Parallel Flow**: Multiple branches execute independently

Execution flows are visualized directly on the canvas, and you can monitor performance and logic using the [Inspect Panel](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging#inspect-panel).
