# SRE security model

> Security is built into the Smyth Runtime Environment from the ground up. Your agents get enterprise-grade protection without extra setup.

<InfoCallout>
**What you need to know:**  
SRE safeguards sensitive data, manages identities, and controls who can do what — so your AI stays secure and compliant.

## Candidate and ACL system

Every operation in SRE requires explicit permission. The Candidate and ACL system acts as the gatekeeper:

- A **Candidate** represents an identity, such as an agent or user  
- The **ACL (Access Control List)** defines what actions each candidate can perform  
- Before accessing resources, SRE checks permissions and denies unauthorized requests  

<code lang="typescript">
// Example: Agent requesting storage access
const candidate = AccessCandidate.agent(agentId);
const storage = ConnectorService.getStorageConnector().user(candidate);
await storage.write('data.json', content);
</code>

## Secure credential storage with vaults

Secrets like API keys, passwords, and tokens stay safe in vaults integrated into SRE:

- Supports HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, and JSON file vaults  
- Encrypts credentials at rest and in transit  
- Enables token-based, role-restricted access to secrets  
- Provides audit trails for compliance  

## Account and authentication management

SRE supports flexible authentication methods to verify identities:

- Enterprise Single Sign-On (SSO) and LDAP integration  
- Custom account connectors for bespoke identity providers  
- Secure token issuance and refresh flows  

## Role-based access control (RBAC)

Control who can do what with granular permissions:

- Assign roles with specific capabilities to agents and users  
- Enforce least privilege principles  
- Integrate with external identity providers for unified access management  

## Enterprise security features

SRE goes beyond basics with features designed for production use:

- TLS/SSL encryption everywhere — no weak links  
- Comprehensive audit logging for all operations  
- Managed vaults with automatic rotation and revocation  
- Secure defaults with configurable security policies  

<WarningCallout>
Security is a shared responsibility. Always review your access policies and monitor audit logs regularly.
</WarningCallout>

Keeping your AI agents secure shouldn’t be a runtime gamble. SRE makes sure it isn’t.
