# Build Agents with Weaver

Weaver is your **chat-first builder** inside [Agent Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview). Instead of wiring everything manually, you describe what you want, and Weaver creates it on the [Studio Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas) in real time.  

You can start with:  
- **Prompt-to-Agent**: describe your goal in plain English.  
- **URL-to-Agent**: paste an API spec or integration URL.  
- **Image-to-Agent**: drop in a workflow diagram from tools like Miro or Lucid.  

<InfoCallout title="What Weaver does for you">
You focus on your intent. Weaver interprets it, asks clarifying questions, proposes a plan, and builds the workflow directly on the Canvas. You stay in control the whole time.

## Why use Weaver?

Weaver reduces the startup friction of building agents. You can:  
- **Prototype quickly** by chatting your idea into a live agent.  
- **Save time** with auto-selected [components](/docs/agent-studio/components) wired for you.  
- **Work seamlessly** with chat on the left and Canvas on the right.  
- **Recover safely** using undo and rollback when you need to backtrack.  
- **Keep your workspace clear** with auto-prettify for layouts.  

If you want deeper control later, you can always switch back to manual edits in the [Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas). Weaver gets you started fast, Canvas helps you fine-tune.

## Key concepts

Knowing the basics will make your Weaver experience smoother:  

- An **Agent** is a runnable automation built in Studio. Learn more in the [Agent overview](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/agent-overview).  
- A **Workflow** is the connected sequence of steps that define what your agent does. See [Building workflows](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/building-workflows).  
- **Components** are the building blocks—API calls, generators, or data transforms. Browse the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components).  
- **Linting** means Weaver checks your prompts and data flow for issues, suggesting fixes before errors block you.

## Quickstart: build your first agent

Want a complete walkthrough? Follow the [Weaver Quickstart guide](/docs/agent-weaver/quickstart).  

Here’s the high-level flow:  

1. **Open Weaver in Studio**  
   Select an agent and click the **Weaver tab** in the sidebar.  

2. **Pick your input**  
   - Type a goal (*Prompt-to-Agent*)  
   - Paste an API spec (*URL-to-Agent*)  
   - Upload a diagram (*Image-to-Agent*)  

3. **Answer clarifying questions**  
   Weaver may ask about data, audience, or steps you need.  

4. **Review the plan**  
   You can edit, refine, or reject suggested steps.  

5. **Watch the Canvas build**  
   Components appear and connect automatically as you chat.  

6. **Test in Studio**  
   Run the agent, review inputs/outputs, and refine.  

7. **Deploy to Runtime**  
   When it works, deploy your agent through [Runtime](/docs/agent-runtime/overview) as an API or web agent.  

<TipCallout title="Skip ahead with templates">
Start with a [prebuilt template](/docs/agent-weaver/prompt-library). Open it in Studio, then chat with Weaver to adapt it to your needs.

## Debugging with Weaver

When things don’t go as planned:  

- Click any red-highlighted block to inspect details.  
- Use **Fix with AI** in chat to repair configuration.  
- Multi-select blocks with `Cmd/Ctrl + click` to fix together.  
- Roll back to an earlier state if you want to undo.  

For a structured approach, see [Debugging Agents](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents).

## Troubleshooting tips

- **Workflow not matching your goal** → Be explicit in your prompt or diagram. Add constraints or expected steps.  
- **Invalid parameter suggested** → Cross-check against the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components).  
- **Agent run fails** → Test blocks individually, use Fix with AI, or roll back to a stable version.

<InfoCallout title="FAQ" collapsible>

**Can I use Weaver without writing code?**  
Yes. Weaver builds workflows entirely from chat. For fine control, refine them in the [Studio Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas).  

<br />

**How is Weaver different from Canvas?**  
Weaver is built into Studio as a tab. You chat on the left, and the [Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas) updates live on the right. Canvas gives you manual control; Weaver speeds up the start.  

<br />

**What if Weaver builds the wrong steps?**  
Edit or reject them in chat, adjust in Canvas, or follow [Debugging Agents](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents).  

<br />

**Can I really build from images or URLs?**  
Yes. Weaver can understand prompts, API specs, and diagrams—letting you choose whichever fits your workflow best.

## Next steps

- Go through the [Weaver Quickstart](/docs/agent-weaver/quickstart) for a guided build.  
- Explore [prebuilt templates](/docs/agent-weaver/prompt-library) to see ready-to-run examples.  
- Learn the available [components](/docs/agent-studio/components) so you know your building blocks.  
- Switch to the [Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas) for detailed edits and advanced workflows.  
- Deploy through [Runtime](/docs/agent-runtime/overview) once your agent is ready.  
- Keep [Debugging Agents](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents) handy while refining.
