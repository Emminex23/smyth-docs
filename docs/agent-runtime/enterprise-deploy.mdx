# Enterprise Deployment Options

The **Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)** is designed for production-grade flexibility. Whether you're running agents in a regulated cloud, on private infrastructure, or across container clusters, SRE adapts to your stack using modular connectors for caching, storage, secrets, and logging.

<InfoCallout title="Need custom infrastructure support?">
For private deployments, regulated environments, or orchestrated setups, [contact our team](https://smythos.com/contact-us) to discuss tailored configuration options.

## Deploy Anywhere with Custom Connectors

You can deploy SRE using your preferred infrastructure tools by initializing the runtime with your own services. The [Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) lets you specify production-ready connectors for storage, cache, vaults, and more without changing your agent logic.

```ts
// Example: Production configuration using Redis, S3, and Vault
const sre = SRE.init({
  Cache: {
    Connector: 'Redis',
    Settings: {
      url: 'redis://your-cluster',
      maxMemory: '10gb',
    },
  },
  Storage: {
    Connector: 'S3',
    Settings: {
      bucket: 'your-bucket',
      region: 'us-east-1',
    },
  },
  Vault: {
    Connector: 'HashicorpVault',
    Settings: {
      url: 'https://vault.company.com',
      token: process.env.VAULT_TOKEN,
    },
  },
});
```

<InfoCallout title="Connector logic is environment-specific">
You can switch between local, cloud, and container environments by swapping connectors while your agent’s business logic stays the same.
