## Use Agent as LLM

### Overview
The **Agent LLM** feature enables using your agent as a Large Language Model (LLM), compatible with the OpenAI library in various programming languages like Python and JavaScript, as well as via API. This lets you encapsulate your agent and treat it as an LLM, seamlessly integrating its multiple skills.

### Unified Endpoint Implementation
The Agent LLM embodiment is an elegant solution for applications that need to access multiple specialized skills through a single endpoint:

- **Simplify Frontend Integration:** Instead of implementing question-type detection in your frontend or maintaining multiple endpoint connections, Agent LLM automatically handles query routing.

- **How It Works:**
  - Build your agent with multiple skills or endpoints (e.g., car_policy_questions, loan_questions)
  - Each skill is defined as a separate workflow within your agent
  - When a query arrives through the LLM interface, the agent automatically determines which skill to use
  - No need for explicit classification or endpoint selection in your application code

---

### Integration

#### Code
- ‚Ä¢ **Base URL:** `https://llm.emb.smyth.ai/_openai/v1`
- ‚Ä¢ **Endpoint:** `POST /chat/completions`
- ‚Ä¢ **Compatibility:** Works as a drop-in replacement for the OpenAI API, requiring no SDK changes.

#### Keys
- ‚Ä¢ **Authorization:** Use a Bearer token.
- ‚Ä¢ **Key Management:** Create and manage multiple keys as needed.

---

### Agent Versions
Access different versions of the agent using the `model` parameter:
- ‚Ä¢ **Development:** `{Agent ID}@dev`
- ‚Ä¢ **Production:** `{Agent ID}@prod`
- ‚Ä¢ **Specific Version:** `{Agent ID}@1.3`

---

### Streaming
Enable streaming by setting the `stream` parameter to `true`. Example request body:

```json
{
  "model": "{Agent ID}@dev",
  "messages": [{
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Hello"
  }],
  "stream": true
}
```

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting**
>
> If your agent isn't responding as expected:
>
> 1. üîç **Check Agent Logs**: Review execution logs to see which skills are being triggered
> 2. üîÑ **Refine Agent Behavior**: Modify the behavior description to better direct requests
> 3. üõ†Ô∏è **Test Using the Builder**: Use the SmythOS builder interface to debug workflow issues

> **‚öôÔ∏è Limitations**
>
> - üß© Agent LLM is subject to the capabilities and limitations of the skills configured in your agent
> - ‚è±Ô∏è Response time may vary based on the complexity of your agent's workflow

## Use Agent as MCP

### Overview
The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** embodiment allows you to integrate your SmythOS agent with platforms and applications that support the MCP standard. MCP is an open protocol designed to standardize how AI assistants exchange context with tools, systems, and data sources, making integration simpler and more powerful.

### What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol is an open standard that enables LLM applications to interact seamlessly with external tools and data sources. It provides a standardized way for AI assistants to:
- Access files and documents
- Execute functions in external systems
- Maintain context across different environments
- Interact with databases and APIs through a unified interface

### Security and Authentication Limitations

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Notice**
>
> - The MCP protocol currently does not provide a standardized authentication method. The community is still discussing different approaches to solving this.
> - If your SmythOS agent is configured with OAuth protection, it will not work as an MCP server. The system will return a message indicating that the agent is protected.
> - Currently, the only available authentication solution requires using a proxy with third-party code running locally. This code acts as an MCP server and authenticates against your API.

### Integration
#### MCP URLs
SmythOS provides two MCP URLs for each agent:
- **Development URL:** `https://{agent-id}.agent.stage.smyth.ai/mcp/sse`
- **Production URL:** `https://{agent-domain}/mcp/sse`

Simply copy the appropriate URL based on your environment needs and integrate it with any platform or application that supports MCP servers.

### How to Enable MCP
1. Navigate to your agent builder page
2. Locate the MCP section under Test sidebar
3. Copy either the Development or Production MCP URL for integration

> **üí° Pro Tip**
>
> Use the Development URL during testing and the Production URL for live implementations. This allows you to test changes to your agent without affecting your production environment.

### Use Cases
- Integrate your SmythOS agent with MCP-compatible AI workbenches
- Connect your agent to code editors and IDEs that support MCP
- Use your agent in enterprise environments that have standardized on MCP
- Build complex workflows involving multiple tools and data sources

## Use Agent as Alexa Skill

### Overview

The SmythOS Alexa embodiment allows you to connect your SmythOS agents with Amazon Alexa, enabling users to interact with your agents via voice commands through Alexa-enabled devices. This integration expands the reach of your SmythOS agents into the voice assistant ecosystem, creating new interaction possibilities.

### Prerequisites

- A SmythOS account with at least one deployed public agent
- An Amazon Developer account (free to create at [Amazon Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask))
- A SmythOS agent that doesn't require authentication (currently only public agents are supported)

### Setup Process

Setting up the SmythOS Alexa embodiment involves two main parts:
1. ‚Ä¢ Finding your SmythOS Alexa endpoint
2. ‚Ä¢ Creating and configuring an Alexa skill

#### Part 1: Finding Your SmythOS Alexa Endpoint

1. ‚Ä¢ Navigate to your SmythOS Dashboard
2. ‚Ä¢ Select the agent you want to connect to Alexa
3. ‚Ä¢ Go to the Test sidebar
4. ‚Ä¢ Select the "Alexa" tab
5. ‚Ä¢ Copy the Alexa endpoint URL shown

The Alexa endpoint URL follows this structure:
`https://[YOUR_AGENT_DOMAIN]/alexa`

Where:
- ‚Ä¢ `[YOUR_AGENT_DOMAIN]` is your agent's domain (e.g., `cma3x279t1rjoee5xc2mgdqfp.agent.stage.smyth.ai`)
- ‚Ä¢ For development environments, SmythOS automatically provides this domain
- ‚Ä¢ For production environments, you can either use a SmythOS-provided domain or configure your own custom domain

Example: `https://cma3x279t1rjoee5xc2mgdqfp.agent.stage.smyth.ai/alexa`

#### Part 2: Creating an Alexa Skill

##### Step 1: Create a New Skill

1. ‚Ä¢ Go to the [Alexa Developer Console](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa/console/ask)
2. ‚Ä¢ Sign in with your Amazon Developer account (or create one)
3. ‚Ä¢ Click on "Create Skill"
4. ‚Ä¢ Enter a skill name (e.g., "My SmythOS Assistant")
5. ‚Ä¢ Select "Custom" as the model
6. ‚Ä¢ Choose "Start from scratch" as the template
7. ‚Ä¢ Click "Create skill"

##### Step 2: Configure the Endpoint

1. ‚Ä¢ In the skill builder, navigate to the "Endpoint" section in the left sidebar
2. ‚Ä¢ Select "HTTPS" as the service endpoint type
3. ‚Ä¢ Paste your SmythOS Alexa endpoint URL in the "Default Region" field
4. ‚Ä¢ Under "Certificate for Default Endpoint," select "My development endpoint is a sub-domain of a domain that has a wildcard certificate from a certificate authority"
5. ‚Ä¢ Click "Save Endpoints"

##### Step 3: Configure the Invocation Name

1. ‚Ä¢ Navigate to the "Invocation" section in the left sidebar
2. ‚Ä¢ Enter a skill invocation name (what users will say to activate your skill, e.g., "my assistant" or "my agent")
3. ‚Ä¢ Click "Save Model"

##### Step 4: Add the SmythOS Agent Intent

1. ‚Ä¢ Navigate to the "Intents" section in the left sidebar
2. ‚Ä¢ Click "Add Intent"
3. ‚Ä¢ Create a custom intent named "SmythOSAgentIntent"
4. ‚Ä¢ Click "Create custom intent"

##### Step 5: Configure Utterances and Slots

1. ‚Ä¢ In the "Sample Utterances" section, add the following utterances (exactly as shown):
   - ‚Ä¢ `{searchQuery}`
   - ‚Ä¢ `ask {searchQuery}`
   - ‚Ä¢ `tell me {searchQuery}`
   - ‚Ä¢ `find {searchQuery}`
   - ‚Ä¢ `search for {searchQuery}`

2. ‚Ä¢ When you add these utterances, Alexa will prompt you to create a new slot. Click "Add" to create the `searchQuery` slot.

3. ‚Ä¢ Scroll down to the "Intent Slots" section
4. ‚Ä¢ For the `searchQuery` slot, select "AMAZON.SearchQuery" as the slot type
5. ‚Ä¢ Click "Save Model"

##### Step 6: Build and Test Your Skill

1. ‚Ä¢ Click on the "Build Model" button (this may take a minute or two)
2. ‚Ä¢ Once the build is complete, click on the "Test" tab at the top of the page
3. ‚Ä¢ Enable testing for your skill by selecting "Development" in the dropdown menu
4. ‚Ä¢ Test your skill by typing or speaking:
   - ‚Ä¢ First say the invocation name: "Alexa, open [your invocation name]"
   - ‚Ä¢ Then ask a question: "tell me [your query]"

For example:
- ‚Ä¢ "Alexa, open my assistant"
- ‚Ä¢ "tell me what's the weather in New York"

### How It Works

When a user interacts with your Alexa skill:

1. ‚Ä¢ The user speaks the invocation name to activate your skill
2. ‚Ä¢ The user then speaks their query, which is captured by the `searchQuery` slot
3. ‚Ä¢ Alexa sends this query to your SmythOS Alexa endpoint
4. ‚Ä¢ Your SmythOS agent processes the query and returns a response
5. ‚Ä¢ Alexa speaks the response back to the user

>**Limitations**
>
>- ‚Ä¢ Currently, only public SmythOS agents without authentication are supported
>- ‚Ä¢ There may be a character limit on responses due to Alexa's limitations
>- ‚Ä¢ Complex interactions that require visual elements are not fully supported in voice-only interfaces
>- ‚Ä¢ The skill must be invoked each time (session ends after each interaction by default)

### Publishing Your Skill (Optional)
