# Note Component

The **Note** component lets you add annotations, instructions, and documentation directly onto your **Studio Canvas**. Notes don’t connect to other components. Instead, they make your workflows easier to understand and maintain, especially when collaborating with others.

<InfoCallout title="Why Notes Matter">
As your workflows grow, it becomes harder to follow what each part is doing. Notes give you a way to explain complex logic, leave instructions for teammates, and label sections so you and others can quickly make sense of the canvas.
</InfoCallout>

## When to Use Notes

You’ll find Notes most helpful when you want to:

- **Explain complex logic** next to a Code or Loop component.  
- **Leave collaboration cues** for teammates, like “Connect to production database” or “Don’t change this API key.”  
- **Visually organize sections** of your workflow (for example, “Step 1: Data Ingestion,” “Step 2: Processing,” “Step 3: Outputs”).  
- **Document context** for future you, so you remember why you designed something a certain way.

## Configure Notes

You configure Notes directly from the settings panel. Notes have no functional inputs or outputs and they are purely for documentation.

### Formatting Mode

Notes support two formatting modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Plain Text** | Simple comments without styling. |
| **Markdown (with MDX support)** | Add headings, lists, or even JSX-style MDX components. |

<PromptCard
  title="Markdown Note Example"
  prompt={`## H2 Header
- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two

<MyComponent title="Custom Title">
  This is JSX-style content inside MDX.
</MyComponent>`}
/>

### Appearance

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | The note’s header. Edit it directly on the block in the canvas by hovering and clicking the pencil icon. |
| **Content** | The body of your note. Write plain text, or use Markdown/MDX if formatting is enabled. |
| **Text Color** | Choose a color for your text. |
| **Background Color** | Choose a color for the card background. |

<TipCallout title="Color Coding Notes">
Use background colors to organize your canvas visually. For example, red for warnings, blue for informational notes, and green for sections you’ve finished. Stay consistent so teammates quickly learn your system.

## Best Practices

- **Document logic near complexity:** Place Notes next to advanced components to explain what they do.  
- **Use Notes for team workflows:** Write clear TODOs or warnings where teammates might otherwise be confused.  
- **Structure the canvas visually:** Add Notes as headers to break your workflow into steps.  
- **Keep them readable:** Always use text and background colors with enough contrast.

## Troubleshooting Notes

<InfoCallout title="Common Issues">
- **Can’t edit the title?** Edit directly on the block in the canvas, not in the settings panel.  
- **Text is hard to read?** Adjust your text and background colors for better contrast.  
- **No connectors showing?** Notes are for documentation only. They intentionally don’t have input or output nodes.

## What to Try Next

- Add a Note beside an **[API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call)** to document the endpoint’s purpose.  
- Use Notes to storyboard your workflow before connecting components in the **[Studio Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas)**.  
- Create a “legend” at the top of your workflow explaining your color-coding system.  
- Explore [Collaboration features](/docs/agent-collaboration/overview) to see how Notes help teams work more smoothly.
