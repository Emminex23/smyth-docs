# Google Sheets Integration
`Google Sheets` is a powerful, cloud-based spreadsheet application that facilitates data analysis, storage, and real-time collaboration. It enables users to create, edit, and share spreadsheets online, providing essential tools for numbers calculation, data organization, and complex data manipulation through formulas and functions.

Integrating `Google Sheets` with `SmythOS` brings numerous benefits, making it an essential component for enhancing productivity and enhancing data-driven workflows. This integration allows seamless access and manipulation of spreadsheet data directly within `SmythOS`, providing a unified platform for managing various data tasks.

## Integration Settings
To use Google sheets integration in `SmythOs`, you must authenticate each integration component by signing in to your Google account. Follow these steps to set up the Google sheets components:

### Authenticate 
To authenticate the Google Sheets component:
1. **Authenticate button:** Click on the blue `Authenticate` button on the Google Sheets component or the authenticate button in the component setting, under the OAuth tab.
2. **Google Sign In:** You'll be directed to sign in to your Google account.
3. **Grant consent:** Once you're successfully signed in to your Google account, you'll be directed to the Google consent screen where you'll be required to grant the necessary permissions to use the Google Sheets integration component in `SmythOs`.
4. **Component authenticated:** Once the necessary permissions are granted, you'll be redirected to `SmythOs` and the Google Sheets component is authenticated to your Google account and ready to be used in your workflow.

## Update Values
The **Update Values** function sets values in a specified range within a `Google Sheets` spreadsheet, providing a straightforward way to update data in bulk. This functionality is particularly useful for updating and manipulating data programmatically, significantly improving efficiency in data management tasks.

### Component Settings
#### OAuth Tab
This is where you can authenticate and deauthenticate the component. Please refer to [integrating settings](#integration-settings) for more information.

### Inputs
Configure the following inputs to perform the update operation effectively:
- **spreadsheetId (`required<string>`)**: The unique identifier of the Google Sheets spreadsheet to be updated. This ID is crucial for specifying which spreadsheet the API should interact with.
- **range (`required<string>`)**: The specific range within the spreadsheet to update, default is `A:B`. It defines the cells that will be updated.
- **includeValuesInResponse (`optional<boolean>`)**: Whether to include the updated values in the response. The default is `true`. This option can be useful for verification purposes.
- **majorDimension (`optional<string>`)**: The major dimension of the values, either `ROWS` or `COLUMNS`. The default is `ROWS`. This specifies how the data is structured.
- **valueInputOption (`optional<string>`)**: Determines how input data should be interpreted. The default is `USER_ENTERED`, which means the data is parsed as if the user had entered it directly into the Google Sheets.
- **sheet (`required<string>`)**: Specify the sheet name, default is `Sheet1`. This tells the API which sheet to update within the spreadsheet.
- **values (`required`)**: The update values in each column specified in the `range` input. This follows a strict format:

> **`Values` input structure**: `[ ["A1", "B1", "C1"], ["A2", "B2", "C2"], ["A3", "B3", "C3"] ]`

1. It must be an array of arrays.
2. Each child array represents an existing row in the spreadsheet.
3. Each item in the child array represents a column. Therefore, the number of items in the child array must match the number of columns specified in the `range` input.
For example, to update the values "Smyth" and "Google" in the `range A:B` to "SmythOs" and "Updated", the values would be structured in this format: `[ ["SmythOs", "Updated"] ]`

> **Note:** Like many components of `SmythOS`, you can extend this list by adding new inputs with the `+` button in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs
Upon executing the update, detailed information about the update status is provided. This includes:
- **Response**: The full API response detailing the outcome of the update operation. This provides comprehensive information on whether the update was successful or if any errors occurred.
- **Headers**: The contextual HTTP headers returned by the `Google Sheets` API. These headers can provide additional metadata about the API response.
- **spreadsheetId**: The identifier for the spreadsheet. This helps confirm the specific spreadsheet that was updated.
- **updatedRange**: The actual range that was updated. This confirms the exact cells that were modified.
- **updatedRows**: The number of rows affected by the update.
- **updatedColumns**: The number of columns affected by the update.
- **updatedCells**: The total number of cells updated. This gives a clear picture of the extent of the update operation.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.
