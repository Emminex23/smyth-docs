# MailChimp Integration

`MailChimp` is a widely-used marketing automation platform and email marketing service that allows businesses to create, send, and analyze email campaigns. 

At `SmythOS`, we've seamlessly integrated with `MailChimp`, providing custom components that make incorporating its powerful services into your agents effortless.

## Add Email to Mailing List

The `Add Email to Mailing List` component simplifies the process of adding a new member to a mailing list.

### Settings

#### API Key

To initialize this component, follow these steps to obtain your `API Key`:

1. Create an account, if you don't already have one.
2. Navigate to your `Account` and then to the `API Keys` section to generate a `API Key`.
3. Input this `API Key` into the specified section in the component's settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

#### Status

Subscriber's current status. Possible values: 

- `subscribed`
- `unsubscribed`
- `cleaned`
- `pending`
- `transactional`

### Inputs

To effectively utilize this component, provide the following inputs:

1. **dc `required<string>`:** The data center prefix associated with your Mailchimp account. For example, if your Mailchimp API key is `abc123-us6`, the data center prefix is `us6`.
2. **audience_id `required<string>`:** The unique identifier for the audience (mailing list) where you want to add the subscriber.
3. **email `required<string>`:** The email address of the subscriber you want to add to the mailing list.

> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs

Upon executing this component, you can expect to receive the following outputs, each providing valuable data about the operation:

1. **Response:** An object containing detailed information about the result of the operation to add the email to the mailing list. It includes status messages, error descriptions if applicable, and any related data about the addition of the email address.
2. **Headers:** The set of HTTP headers that come along with the server response from `MailChimp`. These headers convey additional metadata, such as response status codes, indicating the success or failure of the request, content type specifying the format of the returned data, and other relevant information.
3. **id:** A unique identifier assigned by `MailChimp` for the email address added to the mailing list, which can be used for further operations like updating or querying that specific contact.
4. **contactId:** This is an identifier for the contact profile associated with the email address within the `MailChimp` system. It is critical for tasks like segmenting, targeting, and tracking the activity of the subscriber.
5. **uniqueEmailId:** A distinctive identifier for the email address within the mailing list, which differs from the subscriber's `id` and `contactId`. It is used internally by `MailChimp` to track email activities and interactions.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.
