# Getting Started

<InfoCallout title="Choose Your Path">
You can start building with the [SmythOS Runtime Environment (SRE)](/docs/agent-runtime/overview) in two ways:  
- **CLI**: fastest and most guided setup  
- **SDK**: flexible, direct integration into existing code  
</InfoCallout>

## Which Should You Use?

| Option | Best For | Why Choose It |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| **[CLI](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide)** <Badge type="Recommended" /> | Beginners, quick prototyping, CI/CD pipelines | Guided setup, no boilerplate, works with Studio and SDK |
| **[SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)** | Developers with existing Node.js projects, advanced customization | Fine-grained control, direct integration into your codebase |

## Method 1: CLI Installation <Badge type='Recommended' />

The [CLI](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide) is the simplest way to create and configure new agent projects.  

1. Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @smythos/cli
```

2. Create a new project interactively:

```bash
sre create
```

<InfoCallout title="Step-by-Step Guidance">
The CLI prompts you for language, project name, and configuration.  
It sets up everything needed so you can focus on building your agent.
</InfoCallout>

## Method 2: SDK Installation

If you’re adding SRE to an existing Node.js project, install the [SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) directly:

```bash
npm install @smythos/sdk
```

or

```bash
pnpm install @smythos/sdk
```

<WarningCallout title="When to choose the SDK">
Use the SDK install method if:  
- You’re integrating into an existing codebase  
- You need fine-grained control over configuration  
For new projects, the CLI is recommended.
</WarningCallout>

## Verifying Your Setup

After installing either method, you can verify the environment:

```bash
sre --version
```

For SDK installs, confirm your dependency is listed in `package.json`.

<TipCallout title="Common mistake">
If `sre` is not recognized, make sure your npm global bin directory is in your PATH.
</TipCallout>

## Next Steps

Once you’ve installed and verified your setup, you’re ready to build and run your first agent.  

- Follow the [Quickstart](/docs/agent-runtime/quickstart) to create and deploy a working agent  
- Explore the [CLI Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide) for automation and scripting  
- Dive into the [SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) for programmatic workflows  
- Learn more in the [Runtime Overview](/docs/agent-runtime/overview) to understand how SRE works under the hood
