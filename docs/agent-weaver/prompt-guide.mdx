# Prompt Engineering with Weaver: Writing Effective Prompts for Weaver
> **Good prompt ⇒ Great agent**  
> Weaver will try its best with whatever you throw at it, but the clearer the ask, the cleaner the wiring.  
> Think *tasks*, not *code* — your job is to be the **product manager**, Weaver is the **dev team**.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** State a goal ➜ list skills ➜ add constraints. That’s 95 % of prompt craft.

## Mind-set Shift — Describe Jobs, Not Code

Bad habit (thinking like a developer):

> “Call the `summarise()` function with the weekly_sales dataset.”

Better habit (thinking like a PM):

> “Summarise weekly sales data for Monday stand-up.”

More examples:

- “Translate this blog post to Spanish.”  
- “Email the summary to the team every Friday at 4 PM.”  
- “Resize all images in `/uploads` to 1024 px wide.”

## The Universal Prompt Framework

Goal: [What you want to achieve]

Skills:
1. [Skill 1]
2. [Skill 2]
3. …

Constraints:
- [Any mandatory formats, limits, sources]

Use **Goal → Skills → Constraints** every time.
Weaver will map each numbered skill to an existing component (or ask you to build one).

## Good vs Poor Prompts (Kyoto Edition)

<PromptCard prompt={`Goal: Draft a 600-word travel article about Kyoto.\n\nSkills:\n1. Research attractions and local cuisine\n2. Generate SEO-friendly title and slug\n3. Produce Markdown article\n4. Extract five focus keywords\n\nConstraints:\n- Formal tone\n- UK English`} />

<PromptCard prompt={`Write something about Kyoto. Make it good for SEO.`} />

> The first prompt gives Weaver four precise blocks to assemble.
> The second leaves enough ambiguity to fill a Zen garden.

## Re-usability Tips

* **Name reusable blocks** — e.g. “Keyword Extractor”, not “Skill 3”.
* **Break big asks** into smaller skills — easier to debug, easier to re-wire.

## Prompt Debugging 101

1. **Locate the misbehaving component** (red border).
2. Click **Suggest Fix** and *explain what changed*:
   \<PromptCard prompt={`Output missed the bullet list. Ensure summary is bullet-pointed.`} />
3. Re-run just that block, not the whole agent.
4. Rinse, repeat, ship.

> 👉 *Still wrong?* Break the skill in two. Smaller skills fail more loudly.
