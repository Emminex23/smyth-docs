# Filestore Component

Use the **Filestore** component to store binary content from your agent with components like `API Call` and expose it through a public, time-limited URL. This makes it easy to share outputs with users or systems outside SmythOS.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Binary data generated in your agent is normally internal. `Filestore` makes it publicly accessible with a signed URL.
</InfoCallout>

## Step 1: Define Inputs

| Field         | Required? | Description                                                 | Example             |
|---------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Data**      | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | The binary content to store.                           | Internal binary output from your workflow components |
| **File Name** | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | The name used for the downloaded file.                 | `users.csv`, `image.png` |
| **TTL**       | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | How long the public URL remains valid.                 | `1 day`, `3 days`    |

<TipCallout title="Valid binary inputs">
Use binary outputs from real components like `Code`, `API Call`. This component does not generate content itself.
</TipCallout>

## Step 2: Understand Outputs

| Output     | Description                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Url**    | A public URL pointing to the stored file. |

This URL is valid until the TTL expires and can be safely shared downstream.

## Step 3: Using Filestore in a Workflow

Use the **visual flow builder** to connect binary-generating components to `Filestore`. Here’s how:

1. Use a step that returns binary data, such as:
   - `API Call` 
   - `Code` 
   - `Web Scrape`
2. Drag a line from that component’s output into the `Data` input of `Filestore`.
3. Enter a descriptive **File Name**, like `summary.csv`.
4. Set the **TTL** to control how long the link remains active.
5. Connect the `Url` output to another component.

<TipCallout title="No-code binary flow">
Simply map outputs visually from supported components that produce file buffers into Filestore.

## Best Practices

- **Use meaningful file names** to help recipients understand the download.
- **Avoid long TTLs** unless required because shorter links reduce risk of stale data access.
- **Validate binary format** before mapping to `Data`.
- **Use immediately** and share the URL as part of the same workflow.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If the public URL fails or is blank">
- Ensure the upstream component returned a valid binary.
- Check that `File Name` has a proper extension like `.csv` or `.png`.
- Verify TTL has not expired by the time the link is accessed.
- Use **Agent Logs** to inspect runtime values.

## What to Try Next

- Use with `Code` to package dynamic data.
