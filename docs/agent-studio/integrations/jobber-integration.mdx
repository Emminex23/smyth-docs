# Jobber

`Jobber` is a comprehensive business management software designed for service-based businesses. It helps companies manage their operations, scheduling, client management, invoicing, and team coordination all in one place. Jobber streamlines day-to-day operations for field service businesses, enabling them to deliver exceptional service to their clients.

At `SmythOS`, we have fully integrated `Jobber` capabilities within our platform, providing custom components that facilitate seamless client management and business operations. This integration allows businesses to efficiently manage their client relationships, handle client communications, and maintain detailed client records directly through the SmythOS platform.

## Integration Settings

#### Jobber Client ID and Client Secret
For seamless integration of `Jobber` with `SmythOS`, obtaining secure credentials such as a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret` is essential. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you acquire these credentials:
1. **Visit the Jobber Developer Center**:
   - Navigate to the [Jobber Developer Center](https://developer.getjobber.com).
   - Signup for a new account or signin to an existing account.
2. **Create Your First App**:
   - Navigate to the apps page and click on the 'NEW' button to create your first app.
3. **Configure the App Details**:
   - Fill in the required details such as your application's name, email address, and the scopes necessary for your application.
   - Remember to specify the callback URL as `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback` to ensure proper redirection after authentication.
4. **Retrieve Client ID and Client Secret**:
   - Once the app is configured, the system will provide you with a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`.

> **Note:** Treat the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
