# Key Concepts of Studio

Studio is the cloud-based interface for building and managing agents in SmythOS. You define workflows using modular components that control how an agent behaves.

---

## What is an Agent?

An agent includes:

-  Language models for reasoning  
-  APIs and tools for actions  
-  Workflows to structure logic  
-  Memory to keep context

---

## Key Capabilities

- **Cloud-Based:** Build directly in the browser  
- **API Ready:** Turn workflows into endpoints  
- **Integrations:** Connect to services, tools, and databases  
- **Multi-Data Support:** Work with text, images, files, and more  
- **Templates:** Use ready-made setups if needed (see [Templates](#))  

---

## Building Workflows

Workflows define how the agent operates. They're built from components connected in a sequence.

### Components

-  Perform specific tasks  
-  Have inputs, outputs, and settings  
-  Can handle data, logic, or external calls

### Component States

-  **Success** (🟢): All required inputs available  
-  **Missing Input** (🟠): One or more required inputs missing  
-  **Optional** (🔵): Executes if input is present  
-  **Default** (⚙️): Uses fallback value if input is missing

## Best Practices

**Design**
-  Keep it simple early on  
-  Name components clearly  
-  Test as you go  

**Build**
-  Use version history  
-  Monitor logs  
-  Validate logic and outputs  

**Deploy**
-  Test before going live  
-  Watch usage  
-  Handle errors in workflows
