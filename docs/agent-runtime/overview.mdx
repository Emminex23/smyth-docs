# Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)

<InfoCallout title="The Purpose-Built Runtime for AI Agents in SmythOS">
SRE runs your agents with plug-in connectors for any supported LLM, datastore, or API.
</InfoCallout>

## What is SRE and why does it exist?

The [**Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)**](https://github.com/SmythOS/smyth-runtime/) is ta sophisticated, production-ready runtime platform designed specifically for AI Agents. It provides:

-   Real-time logging and detailed execution traces visible in **Studio**
-   Pluggable [Connectors](/docs/sre/components) for LLMs, vector DBs, APIs, and more
-   Multi-environment consistency for deployment across cloud, on-prem, and local development
## Why use SRE?

SRE simplifies how you build and run agents. It abstracts the infrastructure layer, so you can focus on agent logic without managing credentials, API wrappers, or execution workflows manually.

### Simplified Development

- Clean, consistent APIs through the [SDK](/docs/sre/sdk-guide)
- No need to understand connector details
- Preconfigured defaults for local development
- Type-safe functions and clear interfaces

### Scales to Production

- Your logic stays the same as you move from development to cloud
- Built-in separation between agent code and system setup
- Connectors handle retries, authentication, and service integration
- Compatible with visual workflows in Studio or programmatic SDK use

## How is the runtime structured?

SRE splits the runtime into two layers, as detailed in the [Architecture](/docs/sre/architecture) documentation:
<InfoCallout title="Consistent Across Every Environment">
You can run the same agent with the same logic, config, and security across development, staging, and production.
</InfoCallout>

| Layer | What It Does | Can You Customize? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core Runtime** | Task scheduler, message bus, metrics, quotas | No (versioned core) |
| **Connectors** | LLMs, vector DBs, APIs, auth providers | Yes, programmatically configurable via the SDK |

<TipCallout title="Swap services with a config change">
You can replace an OpenAI model with an Anthropic model by updating a single line in your SDK configuration.
</TipCallout>

## Where can you run SRE?
Anywhere you need... SRE supports multiple environments out of the box. See our [Deployment Guide](/docs/sre/deployment) for more details.

## Is SRE the right choice for you?

### Use SRE if you:

-   Work with LLMs, APIs, or vector stores
-   Need consistent behavior across development and production
-   Want built-in observability and ACL enforcement
-   Care about versioned, auditable agent runs

### SRE might not be for you if:

-   You’re running a traditional backend or monolithic web app
-   You don’t need dynamic or [agent-based execution logic](/docs/sre/building-agents)
