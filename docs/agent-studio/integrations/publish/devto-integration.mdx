# Dev.to Integration

`DEV.to` (often referred to as DEV) is a vibrant platform tailored for programmers and developers to share, discuss, and explore coding-related topics. Unlike traditional companies, DEV operates as a community-driven social platform, empowering users to publish articles, engage in meaningful discussions, and connect with fellow developers.

At `SmythOS`, we've developed custom components to effortlessly integrate with `DEV.to` services. This guide offers a comprehensive walkthrough on maximizing the potential of these components.

## Publish blog

The `Publish Blog` component empowers users to seamlessly publish their articles.

### Settings

To kickstart this component, follow these initial steps to obtain your `API Key`:

1. Create a `Dev.to` account if you don't already have one.
2. Navigate to your account settings and generate your `API Key`. You can do this by clicking [here](https://dev.to/settings/extensions).
3. Input this `API Key` in the specified section in the component's settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

1. **title `required<string>`:** Refers to the title of the article to be published.
2. **body `required<string>`:** Refers to the body of the article to be published, allowing markdown formatting.
3. **description `required<string>`:** Refers to the description of the article to be published.

### Outputs

The execution of this component results in the following default outputs:

1. **Response**: Supplies important details concerning the article that has been successfully published.
