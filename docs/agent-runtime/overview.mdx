# SmythOS Runtime Environment (SRE)

The **SmythOS Runtime Environment (SRE)** is the execution platform for agents.  
It abstracts away infrastructure so you can focus on logic, workflows, and scaling securely.

[View the SRE on GitHub](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre)

<InfoCallout title="Why SRE matters">
SRE provides a consistent runtime across local, cloud, and hybrid deployments.  
It includes modular connectors, a unified API surface, and security controls built into the core runtime.

## Key Features

| Feature               | What it gives you                                                |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent-centric**     | Purpose-built runtime for agent execution rather than generic compute |
| **Unified interface** | One API for storage, language models, caching, and connectors    |
| **Modular connectors**| Swap or extend providers without rewriting workflows             |
| **Secure by default** | Zero-trust access, credential management, and isolation          |
| **Observable**        | Logs, monitoring, and step-level debugging available out of the box |
| **Cloud-native**      | Works the same locally, in the cloud, or hybrid environments     |
| **Scalable**          | Runs efficiently from prototype to enterprise workloads          |

## How to Build with SRE

You can use SRE through different interfaces. Choose the one that fits your workflow:

| Method                                | Best for                          | How you’ll use it                                                   |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview) | Visual prototyping, collaboration | [Open Studio](https://app.smythos.com/builder) and design workflows with a drag-and-drop canvas. |
| [SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)  | Developers, CI/CD pipelines       | Use the TypeScript SDK to create, configure, and extend agents programmatically. |
| [CLI](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide)  | Automation, scripting, power users| Scaffold, run, and manage agents from the terminal.                  |

See [Building Agents](/docs/agent-runtime/building-agents) for help deciding which interface to start with.

## Architecture Overview

SRE is modular. Each subsystem handles one core aspect of the runtime.  
You can replace or extend subsystems depending on your requirements.

| Subsystem      | What it manages                                                                                   |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **IO**             | [Data I/O, storage, API routing, and logging](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#io-subsystem)       |
| **LLM Manager**    | [Language model access, caching, and usage tracking](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#llm-manager-subsystem) |
| **Security**       | [Credentials, authentication, secrets, and access policies](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#security-subsystem) |
| **Memory Manager** | [Agent state, caching layers, and conversation context](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#memory-manager-subsystem) |
| **Agent Manager**  | [Execution, lifecycle management, monitoring, and orchestration](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#agent-manager-subsystem) |

## Security Model

SRE enforces zero-trust access control.  
Every action and resource is scoped to an agent identity with explicit permissions.

```ts
const candidate = AccessCandidate.agent(agentId);
const storage = ConnectorService.getStorageConnector().user(candidate);
await storage.write('data.json', content);
```

See the [Security Model](/docs/agent-runtime/security) for details, or explore examples in the [SRE GitHub repo](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre).

## Development to Production

You can begin building agents immediately. SRE initializes automatically in local development with no setup required:

```ts
async function main() {
    // agent logic here
}
main();
```

When you need enterprise-grade features, you can configure external vaults, cloud storage, logging, or scaling connectors. The same agent definitions work across local, staging, and production environments.

See [Enterprise Deployment](/docs/agent-runtime/enterprise-deployment) for advanced configuration examples.
