# Notion Integration

`Notion` Labs Inc. is a software company known for its productivity and collaboration tool called `Notion`. `Notion` is an all-in-one workspace that allows users to create, organize, and collaborate on various types of content, including notes, documents, databases, tasks, and more.

At `SmythOS`, we've seamlessly integrated with `Notion` to bring you custom components that make incorporating their advanced services into your projects a breeze.

## Integration Settings

#### Notion Integration Secret
To use Notion integration in `SmythOs`, you must authenticate each integration component with a notion integration secret. Follow these steps to prepare your credentials:
1. Create a `Notion` account if you don't already have one.
2. Navigate to your `My Integrations` and obtain your `Integration Secret`.

> **Note:** Treat the `Integration Secret` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.


## List Users
Returns a paginated list of Users for the workspace. 

### Component Settings
To use this component:
- Click on the component settings.
- Add your `Integration Secret` from the `vault`. Please refer to the [Integration Settings](#integration-settings) to learn how to create it.

### Inputs
To effectively utilize this component, you need to provide the following input:
1. **trigger `required<string>`:** This input is used to trigger the execution of the component, so it can contain any value.

> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs
Executing this component yields two primary outputs along with a notable third one:
1. **Response:** This output offers a comprehensive object that details the roster of users associated with the workspace. It's structured to give you an in-depth look at each user's information.
2. **Headers:** This consists of the HTTP Headers that are integrated into the response received from `Notion`. These headers can provide additional context such as the status code, content type, etc.
3. **users:** An important additional output is the `users` array. This array contains the list of users, effectively serving as an enumeration of all workspace participants.
