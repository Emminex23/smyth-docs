# Deploy with Webhooks

> Use SmythOS agents as event-driven webhooks to connect with external services like Discord, Google Chat, and more — enabling real-time automation.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Deploy your agent with a webhook endpoint and connect it to external systems like Discord, Google Chat, or Zapier. Format responses with API Output components to meet payload requirements.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Use Webhooks?

Webhooks let your SmythOS agent act like an event listener. When a trigger happens elsewhere — like a form being submitted, a database record changing, or a user message coming in — the source system instantly sends a payload to your agent’s webhook URL. This is ideal for:

- Real-time message posting (e.g., [Discord integration](/docs/integrations/discord))
- Task automation (e.g., Google Chat or Notion updates)
- Event-based workflows with external triggers

Unlike polling, webhooks are instantaneous, efficient, and perfect for reactive agent workflows.

## How to Deploy as a Webhook

### Step 1: Deploy Your Agent

Go to your agent in SmythOS and:

1. Click **Deploy** in the top-right
2. Name the deployment
3. Select your **version** (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
4. Choose or confirm your subdomain (or use a custom domain)
5. Hit **Publish**

You’ll now get a stable, production-grade webhook URL like:

```bash
https://your-agent.smythos.com/api/v1/chat
```

<InfoCallout>
You can also [Deploy via MCP Server](/docs/agent-deployments/mcp-server) if you need additional authentication, throttling, or multi-agent routing.

### Step 2: Secure the Webhook

There are two main ways to secure your webhook:

- **Bearer Token:**
```bash
curl https://your-agent.smythos.com/api/v1/chat \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer abc123securetoken"
```
Generate your token in agent settings and store it in Vault.

- **OIDC (OAuth) Authentication:**
For advanced setups needing SSO, configure your OIDC client credentials and allowlist email domains.

See [Authentication Setup](/docs/agent-deployments/security/authentication-options) for full details.

### Step 3: Handle Incoming Payloads

Inside your agent, use a combination of:

- **Agent Skill (Webhook Handler)** – this acts as the webhook endpoint
- **Code Component** – to parse and validate incoming data
- **LLM Prompt** – to generate a response
- **API Output** – to return the payload in the format expected by the receiving platform

#### Example: Discord Webhook
If you’re sending output to Discord:

```json
{
  "content": "Here’s your update!",
  "embeds": [{
    "title": "SmythOS Webhook Triggered",
    "description": "Workflow completed with output: ${data.output}"
  }]
}
```

Learn more in the full [Discord Integration Guide](/docs/integrations/discord).

### Step 4: Register the Webhook

Depending on the platform, you’ll register your SmythOS URL in different ways:

- **Discord** → Create webhook in server settings
- **Google Chat** → Use incoming webhook in space settings
- **Notion** → Use automation tools like Zapier or Make to send data
- **Zapier** → Select “Webhook” as your Zap trigger or action

Once registered, these services can POST data to your agent whenever events happen.

## What’s Next?

- Combine with [Scheduled Tasks](/docs/agent-studio/scheduled-tasks) for hybrid trigger setups
- Track activity via [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/agent-settigns/logs)
- Add retry + fallback logic in case of external failures
- Trigger multi-step automations or AI decision trees inside your workflow

# Extend Agents with Webhooks

> Make your agent react to the world in real time. Connect it to Discord, Google Chat, Zapier, or any webhook-based platform.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Deploy your agent with a public endpoint, secure it, and connect any platform that supports outbound HTTP requests.
</InfoCallout>

<Divider />

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you:

- Have an existing deployed SmythOS agent. If not, [deploy your agent here](/docs/agent-deployments/overview).
- Understand the webhook format of your target platform (e.g., Discord, Google Chat).
- Have appropriate authentication set up via [Vault → API Keys](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/vault-sharing).

<Divider />

## Step 1: Create a Webhook-Ready Endpoint in Your Agent

1. In your SmythOS Agent:
   - Add an **Agent Skill** component and name it something like `WebhookReceiver`.
   - Define the inputs your target service will send (e.g., `event`, `message`, `timestamp`).

2. Follow it with a **Code Component** or **LLM Component** to process the input.

3. End the workflow with an **API Output** component to format and return a valid HTTP response to the caller.

## Step 2: Secure Your Endpoint

> Open webhooks are risky. Always protect your endpoints.

You can secure your agent endpoint using:

- **Bearer Token Authentication:**
  - Generate a token and store it in Vault.
  - In the agent settings, enable Bearer Token Auth and provide your token.
  - All incoming webhook requests must include: `Authorization: Bearer your-token`.

- **OAuth OIDC (Optional):**
  - For advanced use cases like SSO or email domain restrictions.
  - Set up via your SmythOS organization settings.

<Divider />

## Step 3: Configure Your Webhook Platform

Once your agent has a public, secure endpoint:

- Go to your target platform (e.g., Discord, Google Chat, Notion, etc.)
- Create or access their webhook configuration interface
- Paste your SmythOS agent URL (e.g., `https://myagent.agent.pa.smyth.ai/api/v1/chat`)
- Map outgoing fields from the service to your agent’s expected inputs

For example:
- In **Google Chat**, the payload must be structured as:

```json
{
  "text": "Hello from SmythOS!"
}
```

- In **Discord**, it looks like:

```json
{
  "content": "Alert: New event triggered by your agent!"
}
```

<Divider />

## Advanced Use Case: Zapier + SmythOS

You can use [Zapier](https://zapier.com) to act as a middleware between dozens of apps and your SmythOS agent:

1. Create a Zapier trigger based on an app event (e.g., "New row in Google Sheet").
2. Use a **Webhook Action** in Zapier to POST to your agent.
3. Parse the payload in your agent and respond accordingly.

## What's Next?

- Connect your agent to Slack, WhatsApp, or Telegram using webhook-compatible flows.
- Automate multi-step workflows triggered by external platforms.
- Add [logging](/docs/agent-studio/agent-settigns/logs) to track and debug webhook events.
- Explore advanced deployment options via [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/docs/agent-deployments/deploy-with-mcp) if you want tighter service coupling.
