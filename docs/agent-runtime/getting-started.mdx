# Getting Started with SRE

<InfoCallout title="What you'll learn">
Install the Smyth Runtime, configure a local dev setup, and run your first test agent using the SDK.
</InfoCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## 1. Install the runtime

Install the package via npm or clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/SmythOS/smyth-runtime/) and follow instructions from there:

```bash
npm install smyth-runtime 
```

## 2. Initialize the runtime

Import and initialize SRE in your project with `SRE.init`. Use a simple configuration for local development:

```typescript
import { SRE, SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';

const sre = SRE.init({
  Cache: { Connector: 'RAM' },
  Storage: { Connector: 'Local' },
  Log: { Connector: 'ConsoleLog' },
});

await sre.ready();
```
This sets up in-memory caching, local file storage, and console logging for you, which is a good starting point.

## 3. Create an LLM instance

Use the built-in `SDK.LLM` to test if an LLM is working. This does not create a full agent but is useful for a quick test.

```typescript
import { SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';

const llm = new SDK.LLM('OpenAI', {
    model: 'gpt-4',
    temperature: 0.7,
});
const res = await llm.prompt('Explain quantum computing to a medical student');
console.log(res);
```

## 4. Stream results (optional)

The `.stream()` method is useful for chat or other interactive applications:

```typescript
const stream = await llm.prompt('Write a short story').stream();
stream.on('content', (chunk) => process.stdout.write(chunk));
```
