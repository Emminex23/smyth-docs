# Quickstart with Weaver

You can build and deploy your first agent in just a few minutes using **Weaver**, the no-code AI workflow builder inside SmythOS.  
You describe your goal in plain language, Weaver assembles the workflow, then you test and deploy.  

<InfoCallout title="TL;DR">
All you need is a [SmythOS account](https://app.smythos.com/signup) and a goal worth automating to create a agent.
</InfoCallout>

## Step 1: Describe Your Goal

Open **Weaver** and simply state what you want.  

For example:  
<PromptCard prompt={`Create an agent that writes SEO-optimized blog posts and publishes them to WordPress.\n\nThe agent should:\n- Write an article from a topic\n- Extract research keywords\n- Post article to WordPress using a given URL`} />

Weaver immediately parses your request and begins planning the workflow.

## Step 2: Watch Weaver Build the Workflow

Weaver enters a brief **“Thinking...”** phase where it processes your goal.  

For the blog publishing example, Weaver:  
- Suggests an **SEO WordPress Publisher** agent  
- Outlines the workflow: generate content, extract keywords, and publish to WordPress  
- Prompts you for details such as your WordPress URL, API token, or publishing preference

/>

If you want speed, you can also ask Weaver to **assume defaults** and generate a working draft immediately.  

Once clarified, Weaver presents a connected workflow you can inspect and adjust.

## Step 3: Test and Deploy

Now interact with your draft agent directly in Weaver:  
- In **Chat**, try “Write a post about Top AI trends in 2025.”  
- In **Form**, enter a topic as input.  

If a step fails, open the block, review inputs and outputs, and use **Fix with AI**. For a deeper look at how fixes work, see the [Debugging Guide](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging).  

When the workflow behaves as expected, click **Deploy**. SmythOS provisions the agent in the [Agent Cloud](/docs/agent-deployments/overview), assigns it a version, and gives you a live HTTPS URL. To learn how versions and rollbacks work, visit the [Versioning Guide](/docs/agent-deployments/versioning).  

<SuccessCallout title="You Did It!">
You just went from a plain English request to a live deployed agent in minutes. That’s the essence of **Weaver in SmythOS**.
