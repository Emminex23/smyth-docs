# Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)

The Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) provides you with a sophisticated, production-ready runtime platform designed specifically for AI Agents. You can think of it as an "Operating System for AI Agents," giving you a robust foundation that handles the complexities of execution so you can focus on building intelligent behaviors, not infrastructure.

<InfoCallout title="Core Philosophy">
SRE is built on operating system principles, providing a clean separation between core services and pluggable connectors. This architecture gives you a system that is modular, secure, and flexible by design.
</InfoCallout>

## Security-First Design

In SRE, every operation requires proper authorization through the **[Candidate/ACL system](/docs/agent-runtime/security)**. This zero-trust model means you can be confident that every action is secure by default.

```typescript
// When your agent needs to access storage, SRE internally
// creates an access candidate representing the agent's identity.
const candidate = AccessCandidate.agent(agentId);

// Access is then granted specifically for that candidate, ensuring
// operations are completely scoped and isolated.
const storage = ConnectorService.getStorageConnector().user(candidate);
await storage.write('data.json', content);
```

## Subsystem Architecture

SRE is composed of several distinct subsystems that manage different aspects of the runtime. Understanding these will help you know how your agents operate. For a deeper look, see the [SRE Architecture](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture) page.

-   **IO Subsystem:** Your agent's gateway to the outside world, managing services for `Storage`, `VectorDB`, `Log`, `Router`, and more.
-   **LLM Manager Subsystem:** Powers your agent's AI capabilities with a unified interface to providers like OpenAI and Google AI.
-   **Security Subsystem:** Manages your credentials, identity, and permissions through `Vault` and `Account Management` services.
-   **Memory Manager Subsystem:** Handles intelligent state management, including multi-tier caching and conversation history.
-   **Agent Manager Subsystem:** The heart of execution, managing your agent's lifecycle, workflows, and real-time monitoring.

## Building with the Smyth SDK

The **[Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)** is the primary interface for building agents programmatically. It provides you with a streamlined, developer-friendly experience.

### Agent Creation and Skills

You can easily define an agent's persona and extend its capabilities with your own custom functions, known as skills.

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@smythos/sdk';

// Define a new agent
const agent = new Agent({
    name: 'DataAnalyst',
    model: 'gpt-4',
    behavior: 'You are an expert data analyst.',
});

// Add a custom skill to the agent
agent.addSkill({
    name: 'processData',
    description: 'Analyze and process data',
    process: async (data) => {
        // Your custom logic here
        return { analysis: 'processed' };
    },
});
```

### Composing Workflows with Components

SRE includes over 40 production-ready **[Components](/docs/agent-runtime/components)** that you can use as building blocks. The SDK lets you connect these components to create complex logic flows.

```typescript
import { Component } from '@smythos/sdk';

// Create component instances
const llm = Component.GenAILLM({ model: 'gpt-4' }, agent);
const classifier = Component.Classifier({ classes: ['positive', 'negative'] }, agent);

// Connect the output of one component to the input of another
classifier.in({ Input: llm.out.Reply });
```

## Development to Production Parity

A core advantage of SRE is that your agent's logic remains identical when you move from a development to a production environment. You only need to change the runtime's configuration, as shown in the [Deployment Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/deployment).

```typescript
// Your development setup can use simple, local connectors.
const dev_sre = SRE.init({
    Cache: { Connector: 'RAM' },
    Storage: { Connector: 'Local' },
});
```

```typescript
// For production, you can swap in robust, scalable connectors.
// Your agent's code does not need to change.
const prod_sre = SRE.init({
    Cache: { Connector: 'Redis', Settings: { url: '...' } },
    Storage: { Connector: 'S3', Settings: { bucket: '...' } },
});
```

## What's Next?

Now that you have an overview of SRE, here are some recommended next steps:

-   **[Getting Started](/docs/agent-runtime/getting-started):** Install the runtime and set up your first project.
-   **[SRE Architecture](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture):** Dive deeper into the subsystems and their roles.
-   **[Building Agents](/docs/agent-runtime/building-agents):** Learn the different ways to create and extend agents.
-   **[SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide):** Master the programmatic interface to SRE.
