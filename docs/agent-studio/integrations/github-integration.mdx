# GitHub Integration

`GitHub` is a web-based platform that provides hosting for software development and version control using Git. It offers a variety of collaborative features, allowing developers to work together on projects, track changes, and manage code repositories.

At `SmythOS`, we've seamlessly integrated with `GitHub` to bring you custom components that make incorporating their advanced services into your projects a breeze. This guide is your go-to resource for a comprehensive walkthrough, ensuring you harness the full potential of these cutting-edge components.

## Add Labels to Issues

The `Add Labels to Issues` component empowers users to add labels to issues reported in a GitHub repository.

### Settings

To kickstart this component, follow these initial steps to obtain your `Access Token`:

1. Create a `GitHub` account if you don't already have one.
2. Navigate to your `Developer Settings` and generate and acquire your `Access Token` by clicking [here](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
3. Input this `Access Token` into the specified section in the component's settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `Access Token` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
