# Agent Collaboration

In SmythOS you can build and run agents on your own or with others.  
Collaboration features give you a shared place to organise projects, control access, and connect agents to the resources they need.

<InfoCallout title="Quick start">
Create a [Space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/), add your team, set [roles](/docs/account-management/user-management), and store any credentials in the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).
</InfoCallout>

## How Collaboration Works in SmythOS

A [space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/) is the main workspace for teamwork.  
It holds your agents, data, workflows, and settings.  
Within a space you can:

- Keep each project or client separate  
- Invite and remove members at any time  
- Control exactly what each person can do  
- Chat with agents and test ideas together in real time  

[Permissions](/docs/account-management/user-management) are role-based and set per space.  
This keeps sensitive work protected while allowing others to contribute where needed.

## Main Tools for Teamwork

| Tool | Purpose | Best For |
|------|---------|----------|
| **[Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/)** | Create separate environments for agents, data, and members | Agencies, multi-project teams |
| **[Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)** | Encrypted storage for API keys and secrets | Any team using third-party services |
| **[Roles & Permissions](/docs/account-management/user-management)** | Set what each member can view or change | Teams with mixed responsibilities |
| **[Sharing & Exporting](/docs/agent-collaboration/sharing-agents)** | Share agents or import/export workflows | Distributed or partner teams |
| **[White Labeling](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/white-labeling)** | Apply your own branding per space | Client-facing or reseller workspaces |

## Setting Up Your First Collaborative Project

1. **Create a space**  
   Go to the [Spaces page](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/) and click **Create Space**.  
   Give it a clear name, choose the right branding if needed, and decide who will join.  
   You can add members now or later.

2. **Invite your team**  
   Use [Invite Members](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/invite-members) or add them when [sharing an agent](/docs/agent-collaboration/sharing-agents).

3. **Assign roles**  
   Choose `Viewer`, `Editor`, `Admin`, or `Super Admin` based on what each person needs to do.  
   See the [Roles and Permissions guide](/docs/account-management/user-management) for details.

4. **Add credentials to the Vault**  
   This lets agents connect to services like OpenAI or Google without exposing the keys.

5. **Start building and testing together**  
   Use [Team Spaces Chat](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/team-spaces-chat) or [Chat with Agent](/docs/agent-collaboration/chat-with-agent) to collaborate in real time.
