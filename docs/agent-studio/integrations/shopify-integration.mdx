  <summary>Why Integrate Shopify with Your Agent?</summary>

Your Shopify store is more than just products; it's a content platform. Integrating its content management features with SmythOS allows you to build powerful automation pipelines.

- **Automated Content Creation:** Create agents that take content from any source—a Google Doc, a Notion page, or an AI model's output—and automatically create and format new blog posts in your Shopify store.
- **Content Syndication:** Build a workflow that monitors your primary blog's RSS feed. When a new post is published, an agent can automatically re-publish it to your Shopify blog to drive engagement and SEO.
- **Dynamic Content Updates:** Connect your Shopify blog to other data sources. An agent could update an article with real-time information, event details, or related product links automatically.
- **Streamline Your Editorial Process:** Use agents to manage your content lifecycle. An agent can create a draft post, notify an editor in Slack for review, and once approved, another agent could potentially update the post to be published.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Shopify account** and store.
- Permissions to create and manage **private apps** in your Shopify admin panel.
- Your Shopify **Admin API access token**.

<Divider />

## Getting Started With Shopify

The connection between SmythOS and Shopify is configured using an Admin API access token generated from a private app.

### Step 1: Get Your Shopify API Access Token
1.  **Log in to your Shopify Admin Panel.**
2.  Navigate to **Apps** from the left-hand menu.
3.  Click on **Apps and sales channel settings**.
4.  Click **Develop apps**. If this is your first time, you may need to allow custom app development.
5.  Click **Create an app**. Give it a name (e.g., "SmythOS Content Agent") and select an App developer.
6.  Once the app is created, go to the **API credentials** tab. Click **Configure Admin API scopes**.
7.  Grant the necessary permissions. For content management, you will need at least `read_blogs` and `write_blogs`.
8.  Click **Save**, then click **Install app** in the top right.
9.  After installing, the **Admin API access token** will be revealed. **Copy this token immediately.** It will not be shown again.

### Step 2: Store Your Access Token in SmythOS Vault
Your Admin API access token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Shopify Admin API access token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `shopify_admin_api_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure a Shopify Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop any Shopify component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `Access Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `shopify_admin_api_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the Access Token from the Vault to **each** Shopify component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which Shopify Component Should I Use?

| If you need to… | Target | Use this Component | Why this one? |

| **Post a new article** to your "Company News" blog | A `blog_id`, `title`, `content` | [Create Article](#create-article) | The standard method for publishing new content to a specific blog on your site. |
| **Save an article for later review** | A `blog_id`, `title`, `content` | [Create Draft Article](#create-draft-article) | Creates the article but keeps it hidden from your live site until you publish it. |
| **Get the content of a specific blog post** | A `blog_id` and `article_id` | [Get Article](#get-article) | The most direct way to retrieve a single article's full content and metadata. |
| **Find the ID of your "News" blog** | Your `store_name` | [Get Blogs](#get-blogs) | Necessary first step to find the `blog_id` you need for creating or listing articles. |
| **Create a new blog section** called "Case Studies" | Your `store_name` and a `title` | [Create Blog](#create-blog) | Use this to create a new, separate blog (like a category) on your site. |

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your Access Token:** Your Shopify Admin API access token grants significant permissions. Always store it in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand the Hierarchy:** To post an article, you first need to know which `blog_id` to post it to. Use the `Get Blogs` component to find the correct ID for your "News" or "Updates" blog.
* **Use HTML for Content:** The `body_html` input requires your content to be in HTML format. Your agent should be designed to generate or convert content to HTML before passing it to the component.
* **Manage Scopes:** When creating your private app in Shopify, grant only the permissions your agent needs. If it only manages blogs, it doesn't need access to `read_orders` or `write_products`.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The Admin API access token is incorrect, has been uninstalled, or is missing from the request.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the token in your SmythOS Vault is correct. In your Shopify admin panel, ensure the private app is still installed and the token is valid.

* **Error: `404 Not Found`**
  * **Cause:** The `store_name`, `blog_id`, or `article_id` is incorrect.
  * **Solution:** Double-check your store name (it should be the `your-store.myshopify.com` domain). Use `Get Blogs` and `List Articles` to verify your IDs are correct.

* **Error: `422 Unprocessable Entity`**
  * **Cause:** The request body is malformed. This typically means a required field like `title` or `body_html` is missing when creating an article.
  * **Solution:** Check that all required inputs are provided and correctly formatted. Ensure the `body_html` contains valid HTML.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful content automations for your Shopify store with the **SmythOS Shopify Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Acts as a content syndication engine. It monitors your primary company blog, and when a new post is published, it automatically creates a corresponding article on your Shopify blog to drive traffic.
    * Generates product-related content. When you add a new product to your store, an agent uses an [LLM component](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/openrouter-integration) to write a "Product Spotlight" article and saves it as a draft for your review.
    * Connects your content and social media. After an agent creates a new article, it takes the article's URL and shares it across your social channels using the [Ayrshare Integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/ayrshare-integration).

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use a [Webflow](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/webflow-integration) or [WordPress.org](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/wordpress-org-integration) integration to pull content from another CMS and sync it with your Shopify blog.
    * Keep a log of all articles published by your agents in a [Google Sheet](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/google-sheets-integration) for content tracking and performance analysis.
