# Components Overview

Welcome to the SmythOS Components Library - your toolkit for building powerful, intelligent AI agents. Each component is a specialized building block that adds unique capabilities to your agents, from basic operations to advanced AI features. Let's explore what makes each category special.

## Base Components

The foundation of every agent, these essential components provide core functionality:

- **Agent Skill**: Define skills your agent can use
- **Classifier**: Automatically categorize input using natural language, perfect for routing and decision-making
- **GenAI LLM**: Generate dynamic AI responses using prompts and powerful language models
- **Image Generator**: Create stunning visuals from text prompts using advanced AI models like DALL-E 3
- **Note**: Add documentation and context directly in your workflows

## Advanced Components

Take your agents to the next level with sophisticated logic and data handling:

- **ForEach**: Process lists and arrays efficiently, perfect for batch operations
- **JSON Filter**: Transform and clean data structures with precision
- **Code**: Execute custom JavaScript/NodeJS code with NPM package support

## Tools

Give your agents powerful capabilities to interact with the world:

- **Computer Use**: Execute complex computer operations using natural language
- **NodeJS**: Run custom JavaScript code in a secure, serverless environment
- **Web Search**: Perform targeted web searches with AI-powered summaries
- **Web Scrape**: Extract and structure content from webpages with advanced options

## Crypto Components

Secure your agent's operations with cryptographic capabilities:

- **Encode/Decode**: Transform data between various encoding formats
- **Sign**: Create and verify digital signatures for secure communications

## RAG Data Components

Build agents with powerful memory and knowledge management:

- **RAG Remember**: Store and manage your agent's knowledge base
- **RAG Search**: Retrieve relevant information from your agent's memory
- **RAG Forget**: Maintain and update your agent's knowledge base

## Why Components Matter

<InfoCallout title="The Power of Components">
Components are the building blocks of intelligent agents. They allow you to:
- Build complex workflows without writing code
- Create modular, maintainable agent architectures
- Leverage advanced AI capabilities through simple, controllable interfaces
- Scale your agents' capabilities as your needs grow
</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices

- **Keep it Modular**: Use Agent Skills to break down complex workflows into manageable pieces
- **Document Your Work**: Use Notes to explain your workflow's purpose and functionality
- **Test Thoroughly**: Use the Debug mode to verify each component's behavior
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic components and gradually add complexity

## What to Try Next

- Create a simple agent using [Base Components](./base) to handle basic tasks
- Build a research agent using [Tools](./tools) to gather and analyze information
- Implement a memory system using [RAG Data Components](./rag-data)
- Add security features with [Crypto Components](./crypto)
