# Airtable Integration

`Airtable` is a comprehensive tool designed for cloud-based collaboration. It facilitates the creation and management of databases by marrying the features of a robust relational database with the convenience of a flexible spreadsheet. Apt for real-time collaboration, Airtable's intuitive interface, customizable templates, and seamless integration with various applications have earned it a prominent position in the business world.

Recognizing this potential, we, at `SmythOS`, offer dedicated modules designed to streamline the integration with `Airtable`. In this guide, we aim to provide you with detailed instructions on how to make the best use of these modules.

## Integration Settings

#### Personal Access Token
To use Airtable integration in `SmythOs`, you must authenticate each integration component with a Personal Access Token. Follow these steps to prepare your credentials: 
1. If you don't have an `Airtable` account yet, create one.
2. Next, get the `Personal Access Token` from your account control panel. You can easily find it [here](https://airtable.com/create/tokens).
  - Click the “Create new token” button to create a new personal access token.
  - Give your token a unique name.
  - Choose the scopes to grant to your token. This controls what components the token will be able to use.
  - Click ‘add a base’ to grant the token access to a base or workspace.
  - Copy the created token as it will only be shown to you once.

> **Note:** Treat the `Authentication Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

## Update Record
A standout feature of our `SmythOS` platform is the `Update Record` component, specifically designed to facilitate the easy modification of single records in `Airtable`.

### Component Settings
To use this component:
- Click on the component settings.
- Add your `Personal Access Token` from the `vault`. Please refer to the [Integration Settings](#integration-settings) to learn how to create it.
- Confirm and close the settings.

#### Body

The `Body` field is designed to hold the necessary body payload, which describes the specific updates that are intended to be applied to the corresponding record. This field is crucial for accurately conveying the modifications to be made during the update process. 

### Inputs
This feature requires 5 default inputs:
1. **baseID `required<string>`:** This is a unique ID specifically for your Airtable base.
2. **tableIdOrName `required<string>`:** Specify the name of the table (or grid) housing your record. Remember, it is case-sensitive.
3. **recordID `required<string>`:** The unique ID of the record you want to update.

> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs
When you use this component for updating records, it provides the following default outputs to confirm and detail the changes that were made:
1. **Response**: This output presents the complete response from the `Airtable` server, containing the updated record's information including any modifications that took place.
2. **Headers**: The HTTP Headers included with the server's response will be displayed here, illustrating the supplemental data that accompanied the update confirmation.
3. **recFields**: This output showcases the fields of the updated records, enabling you to verify the specific data that has been altered.
4. **recordId**: This output displays the unique ID of the record that has been updated, allowing for easy reference and tracking of the changes applied.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`.
