To interact with `Gmail` through `SmythOS`, secure credentials such as `Client ID` and `Client Secret` are necessary. Follow these steps to obtain these credentials:

1. **Visit Google Cloud Console**: Access the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. **Create or Select Your Project**: Choose an existing project or create a new one if you haven't already.
3. **Enable the Gmail API**: Navigate to the `API & Services` > `Library`, search for `Gmail` API, and enable it for your chosen project.
4. **Generate OAuth 2.0 Credentials**: Visit the `Credentials` area, click `Create Credentials`, and select `OAuth client ID`. Complete the setup by specifying your application type and the necessary redirect URIs the callback URL as `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback` to ensure proper redirection post-authentication.. After setup, you will receive your `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
5. **Retrieve Client ID and Client Secret**: Once the OAuth client ID is created, you will be given a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.
6. **Enter and Authenticate**: Input these credentials in the settings section of the component within `SmythOS` and click on the `Authenticate` button to establish the connection.

> **Note:** Treat the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
