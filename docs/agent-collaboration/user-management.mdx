SmythOS lets you manage both **people** and **compute**. This page covers how to assign the right access through roles and permissions, and how to monitor usage and cost using the Analytics dashboard.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
With the right roles and cost insights in place, you can scale your AI agents while staying secure and within budget.

## Roles and Permissions

Roles define what a user can see or do across SmythOS. They apply at both the **space** and **organization** levels. Use built-in roles or create custom ones in [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management).

<InfoCallout title="Where roles apply">
Roles control access across agents, spaces, and tools like billing, analytics, and settings.
</InfoCallout>

### Assigning Roles

You can assign a role:

- When inviting teammates to a [space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)
- In **Team Settings** of a space
- From the **Roles tab** in [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management)

<TipCallout title="Need to add or remove teammates?">
Follow the [Add or Remove Users](/docs/agent-collaboration/adding-users) guide for full steps.
</TipCallout>

### Default Role Behavior

Unless configured, all new users are assigned the **Super Admin** role by default. You can change this default in [Roles Settings](/docs/account-management/organization-management).

### Predefined Role Types

| Role            | Scope              | Best For                      | Description |

| **Admin**       | Per space          | Team/project leads            | Can manage agents and settings in their space |
| **Editor**      | Agents & tools     | Developers, builders          | Can build and modify agents |
| **Viewer**      | Read-only access   | Reviewers, stakeholders       | Can only view content |

1. Go to **Organization Management â†’ Roles tab**
2. Click **Create Role**
3. Set permissions per category
4. (Optional) Enable **Manage Team**

<Image src="/docs/img/agent_collaboration/organization-create-role.jpg" alt="Create a custom role" caption="Customize role permissions for specific needs." />

To update or delete a role:

- Use the **Roles tab**
- Select the role
- Click **Edit**, **Set as Default**, or **Delete**

<SuccessCallout title="Pro tip">
Set a custom role as the default for easier onboarding.

## Usage & Billing Analytics

The **Analytics Dashboard** helps you understand how agents consume compute â€” by task, cost, and performance.

### Dashboard Overview

Youâ€™ll see:

- **Total model usage (USD)** for any date range
- **Daily usage chart** showing compute type breakdown

<Image src="/docs/img/agent_collaboration/analytics-overview.jpg" alt="Analytics Dashboard" caption="Spot trends and outliers at a glance." />

<SuccessCallout title="Always fresh">
The dashboard updates in near real-time as new tasks are executed.
</SuccessCallout>

### Filter What Matters

Narrow results using filters at the top of the dashboard:

- **Space** â€” focus on one or view all
- **Agent** â€” track a specific agent
- **Date** â€” analyze by time period

<Image src="/docs/img/agent_collaboration/analytics-filtering.jpg" alt="Filter options in Analytics" caption="Get context-specific cost and usage data." />

<TipCallout title="Organize first">
Use consistent naming in [Spaces](/docs/account-management/spaces-management) and [Organization Settings](/docs/account-management/organization-management) for cleaner filters and reports.
</TipCallout>

### Understanding the Usage Chart

Each bar = one day. Colors represent compute types:

| Color | Compute Type        |
|--------|---------------------|
| ðŸŸ¡ `#FACC15` | Tasks             |
| ðŸŸ¢ `#22C55E` | Weaver            |
| ðŸŸ¢ `#10B981` | LLM               |
| ðŸ”µ `#3B82F6` | Tools             |
| ðŸ”´ `#EC4899` | Code              |
| ðŸŸ£ `#8B5CF6` | Image Generation  |

<Image src="/docs/img/agent_collaboration/analytics-bar-tooltip.jpg" alt="Tooltip showing usage details" caption="Hover to inspect daily usage by compute type." />

<InfoCallout title="What counts as usage?">
Every run of LLMs, tools, code blocks, or image generation contributes to compute cost.
</InfoCallout>

### Exporting Usage Reports

Click **Export** to download a `.csv` of usage based on selected filters. Great for monthly reporting or billing.

<SuccessCallout title="Export monthly">
Download usage reports regularly to track trends or share with stakeholders.
</SuccessCallout>

### Optimizing Usage

- Use filters to find **high-cost agents**
- Investigate **spikes** in the chart
- Combine with [Work Schedules](/docs/agent-deployments/agent-work-schedules) to reduce off-peak runs
- Check [Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) to ensure agents aren't over-accessed

<WarningCallout title="Zero usage?">
If an agent shows no usage, confirm its triggers or schedule. It may not be active.
</WarningCallout>

## FAQs

### How fresh is Analytics data?
It updates in near real-time. Tasks and costs appear moments after they run.

### What if usage seems too high?
Use filters to zoom in on agent or space. Check:

- Agent logs
- Schedule triggers
- Volume of tasks
- LLM cost caps in your provider settings

### Can I track usage across multiple orgs?
Not yet. Switch organizations to view each oneâ€™s data individually.

### Can I see exact model pricing?
Yes. Visit [Model Rates](/docs/account-management/model-rates) for full provider-based cost breakdowns.

### Who can access Analytics?
Only **Super Admins** and **Editors**. [Review roles here](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions).
