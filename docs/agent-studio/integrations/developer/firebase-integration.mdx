# Firebase Integration

`Firebase` is a comprehensive mobile and web application development platform developed by Google. It provides a wide array of tools and services that empower developers to create, deploy, and manage high-quality apps with ease.

At `SmythOS`, we've forged a seamless integration with `Firebase`, offering custom components that simplify the integration of its powerful services into your projects.

## Create User

The `Create User` component streamlines the process of creating a user within your Firebase application. This functionality is essential for building robust user authentication systems and enabling personalized experiences for your users.

### Settings

To initialize this component, follow these steps to obtain your `API Key`:

1. Create a `Firebase` project if you don't already have one.
2. Navigate to your `Project Settings` in the `Firebase Console` and obtain your `API Key`.
3. Input this `API Key` into the specified section in the component's settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

### Inputs

To effectively utilize this component, you need to provide the following input:

1. **email `required<string>`:** The user's primary email. Must be a valid email address.
2. **password `required<string>`:** The user's raw, unhashed password. Must be at least six characters long.

> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs

Upon executing this component, you will receive the following outputs:

1. **Response:** An object containing detailed information about the result of the operation. This may include the newly created user's ID, status, or any relevant data related to the user creation process.
2. **Headers:** HTTP headers embedded within the server response from `Firebase`, providing additional metadata such as response status codes, content type, and more.

This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`.
