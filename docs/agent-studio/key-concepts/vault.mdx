# Vault

The **Vault** is where you securely store API keys, tokens, and model credentials in SmythOS.  
Instead of hardcoding secrets, you add them once to Vault. When your agent runs, SmythOS injects the right key into the right component automatically.

<InfoCallout title="Why Vault?">
Vault keeps credentials encrypted, scoped, and reusable. You don’t expose secrets in code or configs and you manage everything in one place.
</InfoCallout>

## Add your first key

You’ll use Vault most often to manage API keys. Here’s a simple example:

1. Go to **Vault → API Keys → Add New**  
2. Paste your API token  
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g. *Zapier Prod*)  
4. Choose a scope (where the key can be used)  
5. Save  

Now your agent can reference that key without you pasting it into every component.

| Field   | What it means                         |
|---------|---------------------------------------|
| **Key** | The actual API token                  |
| **Name**| A label to help you identify the key  |
| **Scope**| Limits where the key is applied      |

### Example: Zapier key

```json
{
  "name": "Zapier Prod",
  "key": "zp-abc123...",
  "scope": "Zapier Action"
}
```

This key will automatically attach when you run [Zapier integrations](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/zapier-integration).

## Built-in AI providers

SmythOS includes managed credentials for several AI providers so you can test quickly without setup.

| Provider   | Availability |
|------------|--------------|
| OpenAI     | Built-in     |
| Anthropic  | Built-in     |
| Google AI  | Built-in     |
| Perplexity | Built-in     |

<WarningCallout title="Credits">
Built-in models use your SmythOS credit pool ([see plans](/docs/account-management/subscription-management)).  
Switch to your own API key when you want direct control of spend and limits.
</WarningCallout>

## Bring your own provider keys

For production use, you’ll usually connect your own provider credentials. This ensures full control over billing, quotas, and model options.

| Provider     | Setup Type   | Notes              |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|
| OpenAI       | Manual Setup | Use your GPT key   |
| Anthropic    | Manual Setup | Connect Claude     |
| Google AI    | Manual Setup | Use Gemini         |
| Together AI  | Manual Setup | Open-source models |
| xAI          | Manual Setup | Grok               |

To add a provider, open **Vault → Add Provider** and paste your credentials.

## Enterprise platforms

If your team uses managed AI infrastructure, Vault supports enterprise providers too.

| Platform         | Typical use             |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Amazon Bedrock   | Secure AWS-hosted LLMs  |
| Google Vertex AI | Managed ML + LLMs       |

### How to add

1. Go to **Vault → Add Enterprise Model**  
2. Choose **Bedrock** or **Vertex AI**  
3. Name it, enter credentials, save  

#### Required credentials

| Platform          | Credentials needed                  | Optional settings                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Google Vertex AI  | Service Account Key, Project ID, Region | Context window, Max tokens, Temperature, Top-p, Response formatting |
| Amazon Bedrock    | AWS Access Key ID, Secret, Region   | Context window, Max tokens, Temperature, Top-p, Response formatting |

## Use keys inside agents

Once a key is in Vault and scoped, SmythOS injects it automatically into your components.

### API Output

You can pull keys into headers, body, or OAuth flows.

```json
{
  "url": "https://api.example.com/v1/items",
  "method": "GET",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer {{key}}"
  }
}
```

See the [API Output component guide](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/api-output) for details.

### Hugging Face

Enter your Vault-stored token in **Access Token** inside the [Hugging Face integration](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/hugging-face-integration).

### Zapier

Any key scoped to **Zapier Action** is automatically attached when your [Zapier workflows](/docs/agent-studio/integrations/zapier-integration) run.

## Best practices

- Give each key the **smallest scope** that works  
- Rotate keys regularly and after any suspected exposure  
- Keep separate keys for **development, staging, and production**  
- Audit your usage logs for anomalies  

<InfoCallout title="Security model">
Secrets are encrypted at rest and in transit. They’re only injected at runtime into the components that need them.

<InfoCallout title="FAQs" collapsible defaultCollapsed>

**Do I have to use the built-in providers?**  
No. They’re for quick testing. You can add your own keys anytime, or connect enterprise platforms like Bedrock or Vertex AI.

**Where are my secrets stored?**  
All credentials in Vault are encrypted at rest and in transit. They’re only injected into components at run time.

**Can I share a key across multiple agents?**  
Yes. As long as the scope matches, you can use the same key across different agents and workflows.

**What if my key stops working?**  
Rotate it in Vault. Replace the old value with a new one — components using that key will update automatically.

**Can I restrict who can add or edit keys?**  
Yes. Vault follows your organization’s role-based access controls. Limit edit rights to admins and keep builders on read-only access if needed.

**Do I need separate keys for dev and production?**  
Best practice is to create separate keys per environment so you can test safely without affecting live workloads.
