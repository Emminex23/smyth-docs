# Self-Host SmythOS Studio with Docker

<InfoCallout title="What you will learn">
  By the end of this guide, you will know what self-hosting gives you, the required setup, available installation paths, and how to troubleshoot common issues.
</InfoCallout>

## 1. What’s Included

Self-hosting gives you the **SmythOS Studio** experience on your own machine or server, including:

- Visual Studio Canvas for building agents  
- Built-in authentication, Vault, and environment variable management  
- Debug, Inspect, and run history  
- Local storage by default, with options to connect external services

<TipCallout title="Is this for you?">
  This setup is ideal if you can run Docker on a laptop or server and want full control, privacy, and a simple install path.
</TipCallout>

## 2. System Requirements

Before starting, make sure your environment meets these minimums:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and Docker Compose v2
- At least 4 CPU cores and 8 GB RAM recommended
- A MySQL compatible database (local or managed)

<InfoCallout title="Start simple">
  Start locally with Docker. You can add a reverse proxy and HTTPS later to share access securely.
</InfoCallout>

## 3. Choose Your Installation Path

Pick the approach that fits your needs:

### Docker Compose (Recommended)
The simplest and fastest way to get started is the [Quickstart with Docker](/docs/agent-studio/quickstart)

### Local Development Mode
Best if you want to modify Studio or enable hot reload using the [Local Dev Guide](/docs/agent-studio/local-dev)

## 4. Installation Flow

Here’s the general process:

1. Clone the Studio repository  
2. Create a `.env` file with your required settings  
3. Choose Docker Compose or Local Dev mode  
4. Run Studio and open the UI to start building agents

## 5. Troubleshooting

**Port already in use**  
Stop the conflicting service or change the published ports in Compose.

**Cannot connect to database**  
Check `DATABASE_URL`. Ensure the DB is running and accessible.

**Blank UI or 502 error**  
Review container logs for middleware or runtime errors. Fix `.env` or networking issues, then restart.

**Login loop**  
Confirm `APP_BASE_URL` matches the actual URL and that proxies forward headers correctly.

<InfoCallout title="Logs">
  Use `docker compose logs -f` to watch services start and catch errors early.
</InfoCallout>

## 6. FAQ

**Can I run this on a laptop?**  
Yes. Start locally and move to a server later without redoing your work.

**Do I need a public domain?**  
No. Local setups work without a domain. For shared access, add a reverse proxy and HTTPS.

**Is Community the same as Cloud?**  
Community focuses on self-hosting. Some features differ from the cloud version.

**Where can I get help?**  
Open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio) or join the community discussions.
