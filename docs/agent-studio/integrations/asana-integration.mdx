- **team_gid (`required<string>`)**: The global ID of the team whose projects you want to retrieve. This ID is essential for the component to pinpoint the specific team in `Asana`.
- **limit (`optional<integer>`)**: The number of projects to return. The default value is 50, but you can specify any number as per your requirement.

> **Note:** Like many components of `SmythOS`, you can extend this list by adding new inputs with the `+` button in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs
Upon executing the query, the component provides detailed outputs to facilitate effective data handling and integration:

1. **Response**: A comprehensive dataset containing the project records returned from `Asana`. This includes vital information such as project ID, name, and other metadata.
2. **Headers**: HTTP headers that provide insights into the API request-response process, which are essential for managing connectivity and troubleshooting potential issues. These headers include status codes, rate limits, and other key metadata.
3. **data**: The actual data payload received from the API. This includes detailed information about the projects in the specified team.
4. **offset**: An offset value used for pagination. This is helpful for fetching subsequent pages in large datasets when the number of projects exceeds the specified limit.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`.
