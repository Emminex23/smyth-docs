### Outputs

Upon the successful execution of the `Send E-docs for Signature` component, you will obtain the following outputs, which will provide you with detailed insights on the process of sending electronic documents for signature:

1. **Response:** This is an object that encapsulates a wealth of information about the status and result of the document sending process. It includes the confirmation of the document sent, any error messages if the sending failed, and additional data pertinent to the transaction.
2. **Headers:** These are the HTTP headers that come as part of the server response from `SignNow`. The headers include crucial metadata such as response status codesâ€”signifying the success or failure of the send operation, content types indicating the format of the response, and other diagnostics information.
3. **id:** A unique identifier for the transaction generated by `SignNow`. This identifier can be used to reference the specific document sending action for follow-up operations such as tracking the document's signing status or retrieving the signed document upon completion.
