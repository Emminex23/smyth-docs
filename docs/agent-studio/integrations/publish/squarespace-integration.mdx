# Squarespace Integration

`Squarespace` provides a suite of APIs that enable developers to create applications and integrations for `Squarespace` websites. These APIs allow for enhanced functionality and automation by integrating external services and platforms.

Integrating Squarespace with `SmythOS` can significantly enhance the functionality and automation of your operations. Here's why this integration is valuable:

1. **Automated Workflows**: With the Forms API, connect Squarespace form submissions to various services and automate workflows, such as adding newsletter signups to a CRM.
2. **Order Management**: Use the Orders API to sync order data with external shipping and fulfillment services, ensuring efficient and accurate order processing.
3. **Inventory Synchronization**: The Inventory API allows you to keep your product inventory in sync with external inventory management systems, reducing the risk of overselling.
