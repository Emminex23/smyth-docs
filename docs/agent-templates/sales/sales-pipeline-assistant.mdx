## Customization Tips

<TipCallout title="Example customization">
Adjust the lead scoring component to dynamically weigh criteria. For instance, you could give a higher score multiplier to leads with the title 'VP' or 'Director' working at companies with recent 'Series B' funding, ensuring your hottest leads rise to the top.
</TipCallout>

- **Lead Scoring** – Adjust scoring thresholds in `Code` component (currently 80+ for hot leads) and modify qualification criteria to match your ICP
- **Search Settings** – Increase `WebSearch` `sourcesLimit` from 8 to 15+ sources and enable `antiScrapingProtection` in `WebScrape` for better data collection
- **AI Models** – Switch between `GPT-4o/Claude Sonnet` for enrichment quality vs `GPT-4o-mini` for speed, lower temperature (0.1-0.3) for consistent scoring
- **HubSpot/Slack** – Customize contact properties and notification channels, modify Slack message templates with additional enriched data fields
- **Additional Inputs** – Add optional fields like phone, LinkedIn profile, or lead source to the APIEndpoint for enhanced qualification
