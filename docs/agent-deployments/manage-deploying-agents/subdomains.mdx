## Add Subdomain

1. **Initiate Addition**:
   - Click `Add Subdomain`.

2. **Input Subdomain**:
   - Enter the subdomain and click `Next` to proceed to verification.

3. **CNAME Registration**:
   - Register a CNAME with your domain provider using the details from the verification step.
   - Click `Verify` to complete the process.

> **Note**: DNS propagation may take up to 24 hours.
>
> **Important for Cloudflare Users**: If you're using Cloudflare for DNS management, make sure to set the Proxy status to **DNS Only** (gray cloud icon) instead of **Proxied** (orange cloud icon) when adding the CNAME record. The Cloudflare proxy feature will interfere with the domain verification process.

### Using Your Verified Subdomain

After successful verification, your subdomain is ready to use as a production domain for your agent deployments:

1. • Navigate to your agent's deployment settings.
2. • When deploying a new version, select your verified subdomain from the domain dropdown.
3. • Complete the deployment process as usual.

For detailed instructions on deploying agents, see our [Deployment Guide](how-to/deployment).

## Delete Subdomain

1. **Initiate Deletion**:
   - Click the `Delete` button next to the subdomain listing.

2. **Confirm Deletion**:
   - Enter the subdomain name and click `Delete` to confirm.

## Best Practices

### Handling Multiple Agents

- Use a structured subdomain naming strategy, e.g., **``` {agent_name} ```.agents.your_domain.com** for 2nd level subdomains.
- Verify each subdomain individually for effective organization within a single DNS delegated zone.
