# ScrapingBee Integration

`ScrapingBee` is a powerful web scraping service that handles headless browsers and bypasses anti-scraping protections to extract data from websites efficiently. 

In the array of `SmythOS` components, we provide specialized modules designed to streamline the process of integrating with `ScrapingBee`. This section offers a detailed guide through these components to enhance your data extraction efforts.

## Integration Settings

#### API Key
To use ScrapingBee integration in `SmythOs`, you must authenticate each integration component with an API key. Follow these steps to prepare your credentials:
1. Create a `ScrapingBee` account if you haven't already.
2. Retrieve your `API Key` from the [Dashboard](https://app.scrapingbee.com/dashboard).
> **Note:** Treat the `API Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
