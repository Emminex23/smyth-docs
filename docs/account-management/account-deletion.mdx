## Validation Rules

SmythOS prevents account deletion if certain conditions are still active. These are checked automatically.

### Account Owner Deletion Rules

> Your account cannot be deleted while you have an active subscription.

**What to Do:**
- Visit [My Plan](/docs/account-management/subscription-management)  
- Cancel your subscription  
- Wait for confirmation  
- Retry account deletion

#### Case: Active Team Members

> Your account cannot be deleted while you have active team members.

**What to Do:**
- Go to [Team Members](https://app.smythos.com/teams/members)  
- Remove all members except yourself  
- Confirm everyone is removed

- Cancel your plan  
- Retry deletion once both are resolved

<InfoCallout title="Tip">
Team removal should always happen first, followed by subscription cancellation.
