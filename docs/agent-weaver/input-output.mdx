# Weaver I/O

Inputs and outputs (I/O) define how data flows through your agent in **Weaver**. Understanding ports, types, and chaining rules helps you design reliable workflows.

<InfoCallout title="Quick Guide">
● = required input, ○ = optional input.  
Blue = outputs, Red = inputs.  
Always connect **blue → red**.
</InfoCallout>

## Why I/O Matters

Every agent in Weaver depends on clear data flow. If required inputs are missing, the workflow pauses or fails. If outputs are miswired, downstream skills won’t get the right data. Mastering I/O is the key to predictable orchestration.

For an overview of how ports appear on the Canvas, see the [Weaver Interface](/docs/agent-weaver/weaver-interface).

## 1. Understanding Port Symbols

| Symbol | Port Colour | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **● Solid** | Red input | Required — execution halts until this input is filled |
| **○ Hollow** | Red input | Optional — only runs if input is provided |
| **● Solid** | Blue output | Primary output — data passed forward |
| **○ Hollow** | Blue output | Secondary or derived output |

## 2. Supported Input Types

Weaver supports multiple input categories and structured subtypes.

### Main Categories
| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Text** | Freeform strings or prompts |
| **Image** | PNG, JPG, or SVG uploads |
| **Audio** | Voice or audio file inputs |
| **Video** | Short clips or references |
| **Others** | Structured formats like JSON, arrays, or objects |

### Structured Subtypes
| Subtype | Example | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `string` | `"Write a haiku"` | Most common input type |
| `number` | `3.14` | Float or decimal |
| `integer` | `42` | Whole numbers only |
| `boolean` | `true` | Often used as toggles |
| `array` | `["one", "two"]` | Supports batching |
| `object` | `{ "key": "value" }` | Flexible payload container |
| `binary` | PNG, CSV | Stored in object store; Weaver returns signed URL |
| `date` | `2025-01-01` | ISO 8601 date format |
| `any` | Flexible fallback — not validated |

<PromptCard prompt={`Goal: Summarise weekly_sales.csv and send report\n\nSteps:\n1. Read file from S3 (file input)\n2. Summarise table (JSON output)\n3. Email summary (string input)`} />

For detailed component input/output specs, check the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components).

## 3. Chaining Outputs to Inputs

The rule is simple: **blue output → red input**.  

- Connect a component’s output (blue) to the next component’s input (red).  
- You can pass one output into multiple inputs if needed.  
- Use transformers (like JSON Filter) if the format doesn’t match downstream requirements.  

<PromptCard prompt={`Example: Take "Research Results" (blue JSON output) → Connect to "Summarise Findings" (red string input) → Pass to "Generate Report" (blue text output).`} />

## 4. Execution Rules

Weaver decides whether a component runs based on its inputs:

- **Runs** → all required (● red) inputs are connected and resolved.  
- **Waits** → at least one required input is not yet provided.  
- **Skips** → required input missing and no fallback provided.  

This ensures that workflows don’t attempt to run components without the necessary data.

<InfoCallout title="Debugging Ports">
If a component stays red, it usually means a required input is missing or miswired. Use [Debugging with Weaver](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents) to inspect input/output logs.
