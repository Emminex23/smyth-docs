# Deployments with SRE

SRE supports a flexible deployment lifecycle ranging from local dev to large-scale production environments.

<InfoCallout title="What this covers">
How the runtime initializes, what environments you can deploy to, and how each option supports your workflow.
</InfoCallout>

## How SRE Starts Up

Each time SRE runs, it follows a consistent boot process. This lets you configure it once and scale confidently from dev to production.

### Boot Sequence Steps

1. Initialize core services: storage, cache, vault, logging  
2. Register agent manager and load available [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components)  
3. Set up HTTP endpoints and routing  
4. Connect to model providers and vector databases  
5. Load account and access control config  
6. Signal readiness... your agents can now run  

```typescript
// Example: Initialize SRE
const sre = SRE.init({
  Storage: { Connector: 'S3', Settings: { bucket: 'my-bucket' } },
  Cache: { Connector: 'Redis', Settings: { url: 'redis://localhost' } },
  Vault: { Connector: 'HashicorpVault', Settings: { url: 'https://vault.company.com' } },
  LLM: { Connector: 'OpenAI', Settings: { apiKey: 'sk-...' } },
});

await sre.ready();
```

## Configuration: Development vs Production

SRE is designed to let you swap environments without rewriting your agent logic.

| Feature         | Development Default  | Production Alternative     | Code Changes |
|----------------|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------|
| Storage        | Local filesystem     | S3, GCS, or enterprise FS  | <Badge type="not required"/>   |
| Cache          | RAM/in-memory        | Redis cluster              | <Badge type="not required"/>       |
| Vault          | ENV vars             | HashiCorp Vault            | <Badge type="not required"/>      |
| Auth           | Open access          | SSO, LDAP                  | <Badge type="not required"/>       |
| Logs           | Console output       | APM, structured logs       | <Badge type="not required"/>      |

<TipCallout title="Separation of config and logic">
All deployment changes are handled by the runtime config... not your code.

## Deployment Environments

For a breakdown of infrastructure choices, see the [Deployment Options](/docs/agent-runtime/deployment-options) page.

<InfoCallout title="Supported environments">
Run SRE anywhere: your local machine, the cloud, or an enterprise cluster... the agent runs the same in every case.
</InfoCallout>

| Mode              | Infra Source        | Use Case                        | How to Access         |
|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| [**Agent Cloud**](/docs/agent-deployments/overview) | SmythOS-managed     | Production, staging, MVPs        | Studio UI              |
| **Local Runtime** | Your device         | Debugging, local dev            | CLI / SDK / Docker     |
| **Kubernetes**    | Private infra       | Regulated workloads, teams      | Helm / GitOps          |

## Agent Cloud Deployment

Smyth-managed hosting via [Agent Cloud](/docs/agent-deployments/overview).

### Benefits
- Auto-scaling with HTTPS
- Fully managed infrastructure
- Centralized logs and traces in [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)
- No setup needed and it's the default method

### Steps to deploy

1. Open your agent in Studio  
2. Click **Deploy**  
3. Select **Agent Cloud**  
4. Set [version](docs/agent-deployments/versioning), [subdomain](docs/agent-deployments/subdomains), and release notes  
5. Click **Deploy**  

<InfoCallout title="Use a custom domain">
You can map your own domain in [Domain Settings](https://app.smythos.com/domains).
</InfoCallout>

## Local Development Setup

You can run SRE fully offline or within a test sandbox.

### Local options

- SDK-based boot from code  

```bash
npm install smyth-runtime
```

Good for debugging, testing workflows, or building agents offline.

## Enterprise & Kubernetes Deployments

For more control and scale, run SRE inside your infra.
