# Twilio Integration

`Twilio` is a cloud communications platform that allows software developers to programmatically make and receive phone calls, send and receive text messages, and perform other communication functions using its APIs. `Twilio` provides a range of services, including voice calling, SMS messaging, video calls, chat, and more, all accessible through simple RESTful APIs.

At `SmythOS`, we prioritize seamless integration with `Twilio`, enriching its robust features with tailor-made components to streamline integration within your agents' workflow.

## Send SMS

Initiate the sending of an SMS message through `Twilio`.

### Settings

To initialize and configure the `Send SMS` component, adhere to these straightforward guidelines:

1. If you haven't already, register for an account on the `Twilio` platform to access its services.
2. Navigate to the [Twilio Console](https://www.twilio.com/console) section in your `Twilio` dashboard.
3. Obtain your `Account SID` and `Auth Token` from the dashboard.
4. Twilio uses Basic Authentication, so you need to encode your `Account SID` and `Auth Token` in Base64 format.
5. Once encoded, input the generated Base64 string into the specified section within the component settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `Account SID` and `Auth Token` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
