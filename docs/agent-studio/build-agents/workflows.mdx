<InfoCallout title="Why build visually in Agent Studio?">
Drag, drop, and connect **[components](/docs/agent-studio/components)** right on the live **[Studio Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas)**. Your work saves automatically, so you won’t lose progress. Preview your logic as you build, then deploy with a single click without writing any scripts.

## What Is a SmythOS Workflow?

A workflow is a reusable sequence of steps that:

* Accepts inputs such as chat messages, API requests, schedules, or bulk data  
* Calls AI or other services to process information  
* Saves or retrieves knowledge  
* Returns organized results  

You connect your workflow to an agent through an **[Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill)**. This is the one trigger you configure; all ways to start your workflow, whether chat, REST, scheduler, or bulk, call the same endpoint.

## Core Workflow Components

| Type            | Purpose                   | Examples                                                                                  |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Entry / Trigger**   | Starts your workflow         | **[Agent Skill](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/agent-skill)**                                                                      |
| **Processing**   | Handles AI or data tasks       | **[GenAI LLM](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/gen-ai-llm)**, **[Classifier](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/classifier)**, **[ForEach](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)** |
| **Integration**  | Connects to outside services   | **[API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call)**, **[Web Scrape](/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/web-scrape)**          |
| **Memory / Storage**  | Saves or fetches data           | **[RAG Remember](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-remember)**, **[Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)**                 |
| **Control / Utility** | Manages flow, timing, and notes     | **[Async/Await](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/async)**, **[Sleep](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/sleep)**, **[Note](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/note)** |

## How to Start Your Workflow

| Trigger Type      | When to Use                    | What Happens                                          |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Chat / MCP Client** | User chat or form interaction | Sends a request to the Agent Skill endpoint           |
| **Direct REST**     | Server to server calls or webhooks | Sends a POST request to `/startTrigger` for the Agent Skill   |
| **Scheduled Tasks** | Reports or batch jobs on a schedule | Scheduler calls the endpoint according to your cron setup |
| **Bulk Processing** | CSV uploads or batch lists       | Each item triggers the endpoint separately             |

<TipCallout title="One trigger for many uses">
Set up your workflow once using Agent Skill. It works across chat, code, schedules, or bulk processing without extra steps.
</TipCallout>

### Example REST Request

```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.smythos.com/v1/agent-skills/{skill_id}/startTrigger?apiKey=$SMYTH_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"orderId":1234,"amount":49.99}'
```

## Build Your Workflow Visually

1. Drag components from the library onto the canvas.  
2. Connect blue output ports to red input ports to set the flow.  
3. Name your nodes clearly, like “Summarize Ticket.”

<TipCallout title="Keep it clear">
Add a **[Note](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/note)** to explain complex parts, as it helps when you revisit your workflow later.
</TipCallout>

## Logic, Loops, and Memory

| What You Want        | Use This Component                 | Why It Helps                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Run steps on each item | **[ForEach](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each)** | Processes items one by one       |
| Run steps at the same time | **[Async/Await](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/async)** | Makes workflows faster           |
| Add a pause           | **[Sleep](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/sleep)** | Manages timing or rate limits    |
| Save facts            | **[RAG Remember](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-remember)** | Keeps important info for reuse   |

<WarningCallout title="Keep workflows manageable">
If your flow grows large, split it into smaller Agent Skills and test each part before combining them.
</WarningCallout>

## Control Flow Patterns You Can Use

* **Sequential:** steps happen one after another  
* **Branching:** pick a path based on conditions  
* **Parallel:** run branches at the same time  

For smarter routing, try combining **[Classifier](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/classifier)**, **[Code](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/code)**, or **[Logic Gate](/docs/agent-studio/components/base/logic-gate)**.

## Connect External APIs and Tools

* Call SaaS or internal APIs with **[API Call](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call)**.  
* Grab website data with **[Web Scrape](/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/web-scrape)**.  
* Run local scripts using **[Computer Use](/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/computer-use)**.  

<InfoCallout title="Keep your secrets secure">
Store keys and passwords in **[Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)** instead of pasting them into your workflow.
</InfoCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Test and Debug While You Build

* Open the **[Inspect Panel](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging#inspect-panel)** to watch inputs and outputs in real time.  
* Click any node to see detailed data.  
* Check **[Logs](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging#logs)** for errors and background tasks.  

<Image src="/images/agent-studio-test-run.png" alt="Test and debug workflow" />

<TipCallout title="Find issues early">
Run sample data through your workflow and use Inspect to catch problems before deployment.
</TipCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Deploy with One Click

Press **Deploy** at the top right of the canvas.  
If you need a custom domain, an on premises setup, or container export, see the **[Deployment Guide](/docs/agent-deployments/overview)**.

<Spacer size="md" />

## Tips for Reliable Workflows

* Start with a small workflow and improve it over time.  
* Use clear names and add notes for tricky logic.  
* Always store secrets in Vault.  
* Keep your workflow’s memory focused on what the agent really needs.  
* Test each part before running the whole workflow.

## Workflow FAQ

<InfoCallout title="Common Questions">

**Do I need every component?**  
No. Use only what fits your needs.

**Why is Agent Skill the only trigger?**  
Because every way to start your workflow uses the same endpoint, you only need to set it once.

**How do I debug errors?**  
Use the Inspect panel and Logs to find where data is breaking. Test smaller parts first.

**Can I change my workflow after deployment?**  
Yes. Edit it in Studio and deploy again to update.
