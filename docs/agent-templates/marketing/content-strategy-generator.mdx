## Customization Tips

<TipCallout title="Example customization">
To improve accuracy, modify the workflow to include a **Content Validation** step using a `Classifier` component to verify strategy completeness and keyword relevance before the final output is generated.
</TipCallout>

- **Model Upgrades** – Switch GenAILLM models from `gpt-5-mini` to `gpt-4o` or `claude-4-sonnet` for enhanced content strategy analysis quality
- **API Rate Limits** – Add `FSleep` components between `APICall` operations to avoid hitting RapidAPI rate limits during analysis
- **Keyword Expansion** – Modify Keyword Analysis Output prompt to extract 20+ keywords instead of top 10 for broader content opportunities
- **Multi-Domain Analysis** – Add `ForEach` component to process multiple competitor URLs simultaneously for comparative analysis
- **Error Handling** – Add custom outputs to `APICall` components to access error responses for better debugging of API failures
- **Output Formatting** – Add `Code` component to structure results in specific formats like CSV, JSON, or CMS-ready templates
- **Backup Data Sources** – Include `WebScrape` component as fallback when RapidAPI services return empty or invalid responses
- **Historical Trends** – Add `WebSearch` with `timeRange` settings to gather seasonal keyword data and content performance insights
- **Security Enhancement** – Replace hardcoded API keys in headers with vault variables `{{KEY(RAPIDAPI_KEY)}}` for better credential management
