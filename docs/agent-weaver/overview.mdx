# Build Agents with Weaver

**Weaver** is the prompt-first interface in SmythOS that lets you build AI agents by simply describing what you want. Unlike traditional agent builder tools that ask you to think like a developer, Weaver is task-oriented: you describe goals; Weaver builds.  

<InfoCallout title="What is Weaver?">
Weaver lets you describe your automation goal in natural language. It interprets your prompt, builds the logic, and delivers a working agent ready to run.
</InfoCallout>

Weaver transforms your text instructions into complete, testable workflows without needing to write a single line of code.  
It’s where your prompt becomes agent... and your typing becomes *Smyth-ing*.

## Understand Agent Weaver in 3 Minutes

While **Studio** gives you a classic drag-and-drop canvas for building agents manually, **Weaver starts with natural conversation** in a single prompt box.

> Just describe what you need. Weaver thinks, plans, and builds it for you; piece by piece.

Here’s how it works:

1. **You describe your goal**  
   _e.g. "Help me write SEO-optimized articles for my blog about calculators"_

2. **Weaver interprets your intent**

3. **It asks clarifying questions**  
   To tailor the agent to your use case

4. **It proposes a workflow plan**  
   - Generate blog structure  
   - Write content  
   - Research topics  
   - Publish (optional)

5. **It auto-creates the workflow**  
   Using components from the SmythOS library

6. **You test, tweak, and deploy**  
   All within the chat

## How to Get Started with Weaver

We call this flow **Chat-to-Agent**:

1. **Describe the agent**  
   <PromptCard prompt="Create an agent that writes SEO articles and posts to WordPress."/>
2. **Optionally list required skills**  
   <PromptCard prompt="The agent should have the following skills... It should write SEO-optimised articles, extract primary and secondary keywords, and post content to WordPress."/>
3. **Answer smart follow-ups**  
   Weaver may ask clarifying questions like:  
   - *What kind of blogs are you targeting?*  
   - *Do you want keyword extraction to be optional or required?*  
   - *Which CMS platform are you using — WordPress.com or self-hosted?*
4. **Watch Weaver compose the logic**  
   It picks the right components, configures them, and connects them automatically.
5. **Test, fix, and go live**

> Weaver also supports image uploads or diagrams if you prefer visual instruction.

## Fixing with AI

When something breaks, Weaver helps you debug efficiently:

- See input/output previews  
- Use **“Fix with AI”** to auto-correct components  
- Select and fix multiple components at once (`Cmd/Ctrl + click`)

<InfoCallout title="You're in control with Weaver">
Weaver never rebuilds the entire agent unless you explicitly request it.
</InfoCallout>

<TipCallout title="Fix with AI">
Component broken? Use the contextual repair tool to edit only what’s broken, not the entire flow.
</TipCallout>

## Working with AI-Suggested Modifications

When Weaver suggests changes or adds new components, keep these best practices in mind to avoid unexpected errors:

### 1. Verify Component Capabilities

- Weaver may recommend parameters or features that don’t actually exist in the SmythOS component
- Always cross-reference the configuration against the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components)

### 2. Understand Component Limitations

- Components have defined scopes and cannot perform tasks outside their built-in functionality
- If a suggestion sounds logical but fails, check if the capability is actually supported

### 3. Troubleshooting Broken Configurations

- Compare the broken component with the official schema
- Remove any undocumented inputs or outputs
- Rebuild from default if needed, testing one change at a time

### 4. Use Alternative Paths

- If a feature doesn’t exist, ask Weaver for another way to achieve your goal
- Often, the same outcome can be reached with a different approach using supported tools

### 5. Test Step-by-Step

- Run each modified block individually before testing the whole agent
- This helps isolate the point of failure

<InfoCallout title="Weaver is smart, but not always accurate">
Weaver sometimes suggests features based on logical inference rather than actual implementation. Always confirm with documentation when in doubt.

## Inside Weaver

Weaver combines:

- Prompt parsing  
- Skill suggestion
