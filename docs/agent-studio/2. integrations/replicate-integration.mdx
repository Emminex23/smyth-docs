> **Note:** With the flexibility and customization in mind, `SmythOS` allows you to expand the default input list by adding new inputs using the `+` button situated in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs

When this component is executed, it produces two standard outputs and includes an identifier key for further action:

1. **Response:** This output provides a prediction object that comprises detailed information about the executed request. Given that model predictions may necessitate several seconds or longer to complete, the prediction output may not be instantaneous. To obtain the finalized results, you should utilize the [Get Prediction](#get-predictions) component.
2. **Headers:** Included in this output are the HTTP Headers that are part of the response from `Replicate`. These headers offer valuable context and metadata, such as response status code and content type, which are crucial for processing the server's response.
3. **id:** The output named `id` is provided as a unique identifier for the initiated request. This ID is essential for retrieving the results once they are ready and must be used in conjunction with the [Get Prediction](#get-predictions) component to access the outcome.
