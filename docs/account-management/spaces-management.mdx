# Spaces Management

Spaces in SmythOS act as isolated workspaces, each with its own agents, resources, and team members. They help you manage access cleanly, especially when working across clients, projects, or environments.

<Spacer size="md" />

## What is a Space?

A space is a self-contained workspace inside your SmythOS organization. It comes with its own:

- Agents and workflows
- Data and configurations
- Role-based team structure
- Branding settings

You typically create a new space when you're:

- Serving a different client
- Segmenting dev vs production environments
- Separating internal departments or product lines

<InfoCallout>
Each space keeps agents, data, and configurations private unless intentionally shared.
</InfoCallout>

## Core Actions

You can manage your spaces from the dropdown in the top right corner.

### Create a Space

1. Click your [organization name](/docs/account-management/organization-management) in the top-right corner of the dashboard  
2. Select [**Create New Space**](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)
3. Name your space and optionally add a description
4. Invite initial team members

### Add or Remove Members

You can invite collaborators via the Space Settings panel.

1. Go to **Space Settings**
2. Enter email addresses
3. Assign roles based on what each user needs access to

To remove a member:

1. Open the member list in Space Settings
2. Click the remove icon next to their name

<WarningCallout>
Only space creators can delete a space, and they cannot remove themselves. Members cannot leave a space they were not the creator of.
</WarningCallout>

For full steps, visit the [Invite Members page](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/invite-members).

## Roles and Permissions

Spaces use role-based access control. You assign one of four roles when adding a member. Here’s a quick overview of the key differences:

| Area              | Super Admin | Admin         | Editor        | Viewer        |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Edit Agents       | <Tick />          | <Tick />            | <Tick />            | <Cross />            |
| Access Agent Logs | <Tick />          | <Tick />            | <Tick />            | <Tick />            |
| Add Team Members  | <Tick />          | <Tick />            | <Cross />            | <Cross />            |
| Modify Vault Keys | <Tick />          | <Tick />            | <Tick />            | <Cross />            |
| Manage Branding   | <Tick />          | <Tick />            | <Cross />            | <Cross />            |

## Seat Limit Management

### Seat Limit Warning System

SmythOS displays warnings when you approach your plan's seat limits to prevent unexpected charges:

**Warning Locations:**

- **Space Settings:** When adding members to existing spaces  
- **Create Space Flow:** When creating new spaces with initial members  

**Warning Information Displayed:**

- Current seat usage (e.g., "3 of 5 seats used")  
- Cost per additional seat for your plan  
- Total cost preview for adding new members  

### Managing Seat Limits

**Monitoring Usage:**

- Check current seat usage in Space Settings  
- Review seat costs before inviting new members  
- Monitor team size across all spaces in your organization  

**Avoiding Overage:**

- **Upgrade Plan:** Consider upgrading if you consistently need more seats  
- **Remove Inactive Members:** Regularly audit and remove unused accounts  
- **Plan Ahead:** Account for seat needs when inviting multiple members  

**Plan Seat Limits:**

- **Free Forever:** 1 seat  
- **Private Builder:** 1 seat  
- **Startup:** 3 seats  
- **Scaleup:** 5 seats  
- **Enterprise:** Custom seat allocation  

<InfoCallout>
Additional seats beyond your plan limit incur extra charges. Review the warning messages carefully before confirming member additions.
</InfoCallout>

### Removing Members

1. **Space Settings:** Go to Space Settings of the desired space  
2. **Member List:** Find the list of members  
3. **Remove Member:** Click the remove option next to the member's name  

<WarningCallout>
Space creators cannot be removed, and members cannot remove themselves.
</WarningCallout>

## Branding Your Space

Each space can be customized to match your company’s brand identity. You can upload a logo and apply consistent visuals across agent UIs.

To update branding:

1. Go to **Space Settings**
2. Click **Change Logo**
3. Upload a square image (recommended size: 256x256px)

This applies your brand identity to all agent interfaces in the space.

## Team Chat in Spaces

Each space comes with an optional internal chat channel for collaboration. You can use this to:

- Coordinate with teammates
- Share updates about agent builds
- Ask questions and assign follow-up

Spaces with chat enabled have a dedicated messaging section. See [Team Spaces Chat](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/team-spaces-chat) for usage tips.

## Space Deletion Rules

You can only delete a space if you created it. Before deletion:

1. Remove all agents, subdomains, and members
2. Ensure no active deployments or billing ties
3. Then proceed to delete from **Space Settings**

<WarningCallout title="Double check before space deletion">
Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.
</WarningCallout>
