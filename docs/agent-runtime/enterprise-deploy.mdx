# Enterprise & Self-Hosted Deployment

The **Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)** is designed for production-grade flexibility. You can run SRE on your own private infrastructure by using its modular connectors for caching, storage, secrets, and logging.

<InfoCallout title="When to Self-Host">
Self-hosting is ideal when you need maximum control over your data, security, and infrastructure, or to integrate SRE directly into your existing cloud environment.
</InfoCallout>

## Deploying with Custom Connectors

You can deploy SRE to your preferred infrastructure by initializing the runtime with your own services. The [Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) lets you specify production-ready connectors for storage, cache, and vaults without changing your agent's core logic.

This example shows a production configuration using Redis for caching, AWS S3 for storage, and HashiCorp Vault for secrets.

```typescript
// Example: Production configuration for a self-hosted environment
import { SRE } from 'smyth-runtime';

const sre = SRE.init({
  Cache: {
    Connector: 'Redis',
    Settings: {
      url: 'redis://your-cluster-endpoint',
      maxMemory: '10gb',
    },
  },
  Storage: {
    Connector: 'S3',
    Settings: {
      bucket: 'your-production-bucket',
      region: 'us-east-1',
    },
  },
  Vault: {
    Connector: 'HashicorpVault',
    Settings: {
      url: 'https://vault.your-company.com',
      token: process.env.VAULT_TOKEN,
    },
  },
});
```

<InfoCallout title="Configuration is separate from logic">
You can switch between local development and a self-hosted production environment just by changing the configuration, while your agentâ€™s business logic stays the same.
</InfoCallout>

## Supported Infrastructure

SRE's flexible architecture supports various self-hosted environments:

- **Private Servers**
- **Cloud Providers** (e.g., using AWS S3 and AWS Secrets Manager connectors)
- **Docker Containers**, as SRE is designed to be container-ready

<WarningCallout title="Looking for deployment examples?">
Reach out to [SmythOS support](https://smythos.com/contact-us) for examples of `Dockerfiles` or guidance on specific cloud configurations.

## Connecting to Platform Features

Self-hosted SRE deployments still integrate with core platform features for security and organization:

- **[Vaults](/docs/agent-runtime/security)** for secure secret management
- **[Roles and Permissions](/docs/agent-runtime/security)** for secure runtime control
