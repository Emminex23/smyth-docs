# Agent Work Schedules

Use **Work Schedules** to automate when your agent runs a specific task. You define the endpoint, provide inputs, and choose when (and how often) it should run. SmythOS takes care of the rest.

<InfoCallout>
Work Schedules make your agent self-operating. Ideal for time-based operations like daily updates, weekly reports, or periodic syncs.

## Where to Configure Work Schedules

1. Go to the **Agents** page
2. Click into your deployed agent
3. Navigate to the **Settings** tab
4. Scroll down to the **Tasks** section
5. Click `Add New` under the **Schedule** area

## One-Time Task

For tasks that should run **only once** at a future time:

1. Choose the endpoint you want to run
2. Fill in the required input parameters
3. Under **Repeat**, select `No Repeat`
4. Set the **execution time**
5. (Optional) Name the routine
6. Click `Done`

The routine will run once at the scheduled time, then disappear.

## Recurring Task

For tasks that should run **repeatedly** on a schedule:

1. Choose the endpoint
2. Enter input parameters
3. Under **Repeat**, choose `Repeat`
4. Configure repetition:
   - **Repeat Every** (e.g. day, week)
   - **Repeat On** (e.g. Monday, Friday)
   - **End Condition**: never, after X times, or on a date
5. (Optional) Add a name
6. Click `Done`

The routine will now execute at the defined intervals.

## View and Track Scheduled Tasks

Each schedule you create appears in the **Schedule** list.

Click any routine to open its details:

- **Info Tab**: Name, endpoint, inputs, next run
- **Triggers Tab**: Run history
- **Logs Tab**: Link to Logs Explorer for full debug output

You can use these views to monitor performance or make edits if needed.
