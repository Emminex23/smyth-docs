# Workflows

A **workflow** in SmythOS is a self-contained sequence of **components**—modular blocks that query data, perform actions, transform inputs, and run logic. Workflows can execute on a schedule, in response to webhooks, via API calls, through chat interactions, or on any other supported embodiment (voice, batch, UI button).

## Assemble components that interact with data

Workflows consist of **components**. Each component can:

- **Query** a data source (e.g., database, spreadsheet, RAG search)  
- **Act** on external services (e.g., HTTP API, SaaS integration)  
- **Process** data (e.g., JavaScript code, math operations)  
- and much more. For more detailed list, refer to [components]

Drag and drop components in the Workflow IDE, configure inputs, settings, and error paths, then connect them to define control flow.

## Define control flow

Connections between components determine execution order and data passing:

- **Sequential path**: one component after another.  
- **Branching**: parallel or conditional paths using the Branch component.  

## Invoke via Agent or API

Workflows can be triggered in three ways:

- **Direct API Call**  
  Each workflow has its own REST endpoint. Call it from your code [check below]
```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://api.smythos.com/v1/workflows/{workflow_id}/startTrigger?apiKey=$SMYTH_WORKFLOW_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"orderId":1234,"amount":49.99}'

- **Agent Invocation**  
  An agent orchestrates one or more workflows in response to chat, voice, or other embodiments. Within the agent’s workflow canvas, connect the Agent Skill to the start of a workflow.

- **Task Invocation**
  Tasks can be triggered through scheduled runs or batch processing, allowing for automated execution of workflows at specified intervals or in bulk operations.
