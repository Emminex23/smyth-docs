# Hybrid Workflows in SRE

SRE supports both visual and code-based agent development. You can use either mode or combine them for maximum efficiency.

<InfoCallout title="Why hybrid workflows matter">
Studio gives you speed and clarity. SDK gives you full control. Hybrid workflows let you design in one place, extend in another, and keep everything working as one agent.
</InfoCallout>

## What Is a Hybrid Workflow?

A **hybrid workflow** means you’re not locked into one way of working. With [SRE](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture), agents are portable between [Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview) and [SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide).

You can:

- Prototype logic quickly with the drag-and-drop [visual editor](/docs/agent-studio/overview)
- Export to SDK for CI/CD, testing, or advanced logic
- Re-import into Studio for debugging or business handoff

You can start building your agent in Studio and export it to code. Or, build in the SDK and bring it into Studio to visualize, test, or extend it.

This flexibility means you never have to choose between speed and control.

## Why use both?

Some use cases are just better solved with visuals—like laying out logic, testing flows, or collaborating across teams. Others need the power of custom logic, deep integrations, or version-controlled code.

Hybrid workflows give you the best of both worlds.

| Use case                             | Best tool      | Example                                         |
|-------------------------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Rapid prototyping                   | Studio         | Drag components and test instantly              |
| CI/CD and version control           | SDK            | Store agent code in Git                         |
| Custom logic or third-party code    | SDK            | Build a skill that queries an external API      |
| Non-technical stakeholder input     | Studio         | Let business users shape logic visually         |
| Schema enforcement + testing        | SDK            | Add type checks to your agent’s response flow   |


## Why Use Hybrid Workflows?

Some things are just easier visually, like laying out logic or sharing ideas with non-technical teammates. Others need full code control, versioning, and custom integrations. **Hybrid workflows let you do both without compromise.**

<InfoCallout title="Who is this for?">
Hybrid workflows are ideal if you:

- Want to **prototype fast** but scale in code  
- Work in **cross-functional teams** (e.g. product + dev)  
- Need **visual clarity** for logic but **code control** for extensions  
- Use Studio for testing and observability, but want SDK for CI/CD

## Exporting from Studio to SDK

Visual agents are stored as structured data. You can export them as `.smyth` files and load them in code.

### Step-by-step

1. Open your agent in Studio  
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + E` (Windows) or `⌘ + Shift + E` (Mac) to export  
3. Save the `.smyth` file  
4. Load it in the SDK:

```typescript
import { SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';
import agentData from './my-agent.smyth';

const agent = new SDK.Agent(agentData);
const result = await agent.prompt('Summarize this text');
```
Once imported, you can use all the SDK features like:

- Adding custom skills
- Connecting components programmatically
- Running tests or simulations

Your agent is now ready to extend, wrap in a service, or test in code. See [the SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) for full details.
<InfoCallout title="Behind the scenes of Studio" collapsible>

Studio agents are stored as structured JSON, which makes them portable and editable in both code and visual environments.

Each connection between components is explicitly defined. For example, if you connect a language model to a classifier, the data might look like this:

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "sourceId": "llm_1",
      "targetId": "classifier_1",
      "sourceIndex": 0,
      "targetIndex": 0
    }
  ]
}
```
This format allows smooth import/export between Studio and SDK, so agents remain portable and editable across both modes.
</InfoCallout>

## Importing SDK Agents into Studio

You can take any SDK-defined agent and visualize it in Studio.

### Step-by-step

<WarningCallout title="Sync changes manually">
If you edit the agent’s structure in SDK, re-import the .smyth file into Studio to reflect those changes. Always test imported agents before deploying.
</WarningCallout>

1. Build your agent in SDK  
2. Export the data structure:

```typescript
const agent = new SDK.Agent({ name: 'HybridAgent', model: 'gpt-4' });
// Add logic, skills, or components
const agentData = agent.data;
// Save as JSON
fs.writeFileSync('agent-for-studio.json', JSON.stringify(agentData));
```

3. In Studio, go to **Create Agent → Import**  
4. Drag the exported file onto the canvas or use the upload prompt

Studio automatically loads the logic, components, and configuration so you can inspect, debug, and extend it visually.

<InfoCallout title="Instant import tip">
You can also drag a `.smyth` file directly into the Studio canvas to import it on the fly.
</InfoCallout>

## How SRE Dual Creation Mode Works

This seamless transition works because Studio and SDK use the same underlying agent schema.

- Studio exports agents as portable `.smyth` definitions
- SDK loads and writes the same format
- All metadata, component configs, and flow links stay intact

This means you can start visual, shift to code, and even hand back to visual again without rework.
