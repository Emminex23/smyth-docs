# Enterprise Deployment Options

Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) supports configurable, production-ready deployments using a connector-based system. This lets you swap services like storage, cache, logging, and secrets without changing your agent logic.

<InfoCallout title="SRE adapts to your needs">
SRE is designed to adapt to your environment whether you're running locally, in the cloud, or across teams.
</InfoCallout>

## Production-Ready Configuration

Use the [Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) to initialize SRE with production services:

```ts
const sre = SRE.init({
  Cache: {
    Connector: 'Redis',
    Settings: {
      url: 'redis://your-cluster',
      maxMemory: '10gb',
    },
  },
  Storage: {
    Connector: 'S3',
    Settings: {
      bucket: 'your-bucket',
      region: 'us-east-1',
    },
  },
  Vault: {
    Connector: 'HashicorpVault',
    Settings: {
      url: 'https://vault.company.com',
      token: process.env.VAULT_TOKEN,
    },
  },
});
```
<InfoCallout title="Environment-aware design"> Business logic stays the same between local development and production. Only the connectors change. </InfoCallout>

## Need a Custom Deployment?

If you're running in a specialized infrastructure (private cloud, containerized setup, or regulated environment), we can help configure SRE to match your requirements.
