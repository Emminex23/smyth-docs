- **Streamlining Collaboration:** Facilitating seamless document sharing and collaboration among team members.
- **Enhancing Productivity:** Automating workflows and processes, thereby reducing manual tasks.
- **Centralizing Data Management:** Enabling centralized access to documents and resources, improving organizational efficiency.
- **Ensuring Security:** Providing secure access to sensitive information, complying with organizational policies and regulations.

## Get Root Site

Retrieves the root SharePoint site within a tenant.

### üõ† Settings

#### Client ID & Client Secret

To kickstart this component, follow these initial steps to obtain your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` using Microsoft Entra:

1. **Register Your Application:**
   - Go to the [Microsoft Entra Portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** and select **App registrations**.
   - Click on **New registration** to create a new application.

2. **Provide Application Details:**
   - **Name:** Enter a name for your application.
   - **Supported account types:** Choose the account types that you want to support. This can be:
     - Accounts in this organizational directory only.
     - Accounts in any organizational directory.
     - Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts.
   - **Redirect URI:** Select `Web` and enter `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback` as the URI.
   - Click on **Register**.

3. **Obtain Client ID & Client Secret:**
   - **Client ID:** Once registered, go to the **Overview** section of your new application to find your `Client ID` (also known as the Application ID). Copy this value.
   - **Client Secret:**
     - Navigate to **Certificates & secrets**.
     - In the **Client secrets** section, click on **New client secret**.
     - Provide a description and choose an expiration period.
     - Click on **Add**.
     - Copy the client secret value displayed. This is your `Client Secret`. Ensure you copy it now because it will be hidden once you leave the page.

4. **Configure API Permissions:**
   - **API Permissions:** Ensure the necessary permissions to use SharePoint are configured. This usually includes granting permissions like `Sites.Read.All` and `Sites.ReadWrite.All`. For detailed steps, refer to the Microsoft documentation on configuring API permissions.

5. **Enter Credentials in SmythOS:**
   - Navigate to the settings section of the component in SmythOS.
   - Enter the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` that you obtained from the Microsoft Entra portal.
   - Click on the **Authenticate** button to connect the component to Microsoft Teams.

> **Note:** Treat the `Client ID` & `Client Secret` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

#### üîë Authenticate/Sign Out Button

The component provides a versatile button designed to toggle between **Authenticate** and **Sign Out** based on the current authentication state within the OAuth setup.

- **Authenticate Button**: This button serves as an additional method to authenticate, complementing the main **Authenticate** button already present in the component.
- **Sign Out Button**: Allows users to sign out when they are currently authenticated.

This button serves a critical role in scenarios where the component cannot retrieve a valid token due to reasons such as:
- The token is invalid.
- The token has expired.
- Other token-related issues.

In such cases, you can use the combo action of signing out and authenticating again to resolve these token-related problems, ensuring seamless authentication management within your application.
