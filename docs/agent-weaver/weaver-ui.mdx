# Weaver Interface

Weaver’s interface combines a **chat panel and visual Canvas** into a single workspace. You describe your goals in natural language, and Weaver begins mapping the workflow while you watch it come to life.  

If you want to see practical examples of prompts, browse the [Prompt Library](/docs/agent-weaver/prompt-library). To follow a step-by-step build, try the [Weaver Quickstart](/docs/agent-weaver/quickstart).  

<InfoCallout title="How Weaver Guides You">
Weaver does not immediately drop blocks onto the Canvas. It first explains its plan, asks clarifying questions, and only then begins building. This transparency helps you understand what is happening and keeps you in control.

## Main Panels

Weaver’s interface has three main areas that work together:  

| Panel | What You’ll See |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Chat Panel** | Where you describe your goals, view Weaver’s “thinking aloud,” and respond to follow-up questions. Logs and test results also appear here. |
| **Planned Workflows & Skill Suggestions** | A draft plan of the steps Weaver thinks the workflow should include, along with recommended components for each. |
| **Component Canvas** | A live diagram of your workflow. Components appear and connect here automatically, and you can edit them directly at any time. |

<TipCallout title="Example Flow">
If you ask *“Help me write a blog about AI agents”*, the chat panel will show Weaver’s reasoning. In Planned Workflows you may see steps like “Research topics,” “Generate outline,” and “Write draft.” At the same time, the Canvas begins wiring those steps together with components.

## How Workflows Are Planned

When you provide a goal, Weaver drafts a workflow before building it. For a blog-writing request, the plan could include:  

- **Generate Outline** (titles and headings)  
- **Research Supporting Material**  
- **Write Full Draft**  
- **Optional: Publish Blog**  

To refine the plan, Weaver often asks questions such as:  
- *“Do you want technical, lifestyle, or marketing content?”*  
- *“How long should the blog usually be?”*  

This back-and-forth ensures the workflow reflects your actual needs instead of assumptions.

## Working with Components

Once the Canvas begins to fill with components, you can interact with them directly:  

- **Click** a block to open its inspector.  
- **Ctrl/Cmd + click** to select multiple blocks for editing or re-running.  
- **Shift + click** empty space to clear your selection.  

Weaver will automatically suggest components, but you can also add your own. The [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components) lists all available blocks, such as API connectors, content generators, and transformers.

## Using Diagrams as Inputs

You can drag and drop PNG, JPG, or SVG files into the chat. Weaver interprets these diagrams as a starting point by:  

- Extracting text from the image.  
- Reading arrows as potential data flows.  
- Suggesting components that match what it sees.  

<TipCallout title="From Whiteboard to Canvas">
A quick snapshot of a whiteboard sketch is often enough for Weaver to suggest a working workflow structure.

## Contextual Actions

Weaver provides contextual actions that appear when you hover or click on components:  

| Action | When It Appears | What It Does |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Fix with AI** | When a component shows red or orange | Opens a pre-filled repair prompt with error context so Weaver can fix the issue. |
| **Explain Component** | Any time | Gives a plain-language explanation of what the block does, including inputs and outputs. |
| **Trash** | On hover | Deletes the component and reroutes connections when possible. |

<TipCallout title="Watch Component Colours">
Green means healthy, orange is a warning, and red signals a failure. Most problems can be fixed quickly using **Fix with AI**. For more advanced troubleshooting, see [Debugging Agents](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents).

# Next Steps

The interface is only one part of working with Weaver. To keep learning:  

- Explore the [Prompt Library](/docs/agent-weaver/prompt-library) for practical examples across use cases.  
- Walk through the [Weaver Quickstart](/docs/agent-weaver/quickstart) to build your first complete agent.  
- Review available components in the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components) to understand what Weaver uses when wiring workflows.  
- Refer to [Debugging Agents](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents) whenever you run into issues.
