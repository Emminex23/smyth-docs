# Roles and Permissions

SmythOS uses **role-based access control (RBAC)** to manage what users can view or change. Each user is assigned a role that defines their level of control across the workspace, agents, and organization settings.

<InfoCallout>
Roles ensure secure, scalable collaborationâ€”whether you're building with teammates or sharing with stakeholders.
