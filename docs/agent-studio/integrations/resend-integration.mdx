# Resend Integration

`Resend` is a renowned organization specializing in the domain of email services. They have developed an intuitive, easy-to-use email platform packed with advanced features such as user-friendly interface, range of templates, and easy integrations. 

Within the vast panorama of `SmythOS` components, we offer dedicated modules to simplify integration with `Resend`. This section provides a comprehensive walk-through of these components.

## Send Email

This fundamental component of `SmythOS` is designed for immediately sending out emails.

> **Note:** Ensure that for enabling email dispatch in a Production environment, you verify your domains in `Resend`.

### Settings

To bring this component to life, an essential pre-requisite is setting the `Authentication Key`.

Here is a step-by-step guide to obtaining this:

1. If you do not possess a `Resend` account, please set one up.
2. Obtain the `Authentication Key` from [Resend's API keys page](https://resend.com/api-keys).
3. Input the `Authentication Key` into the designated section in the settings.

> **Note:** Treat the `Authentication Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

### Inputs

This component requires 4 default inputs:

1. **From `required<string>`:** This represents the sender's email. You can provide it in two formats: `email@example.com` or `Name <email@example.com>`. The email must be from a Resend-registered domain.
2. **To `required<string>`:** This is intended for the recipient(s) email address(es). It can accept a single email address or an array of email addresses.
3. **Subject `required<string>`:** This is the main theme or topic of the email.
4. **Text `required<string>`:** This is the main content body of your email.

> **Note:** Like many components of `SmythOS`, you can extend this list by adding new inputs with the `+` button in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs

This component comes with 2 default outputs:

1. **Response:** This output signifies the response received after an email is successfully sent. It provides valuable information for debugging and confirming that the operation was successfully executed.
2. **Headers:** These are the HTTP Headers provided in the response from the `Resend` server. These headers can contain important information such as sender, receiver, timestamp of the email sent, and more. This can be particularly helpful for logging, debugging, and tracking the emails sent.
3. **id:** This output contains the unique identifier associated with the email-sending operation.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.
