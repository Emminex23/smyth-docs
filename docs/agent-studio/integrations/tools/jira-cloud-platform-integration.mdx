# Jira Cloud Platform Integration

`Jira Cloud Platform` is a comprehensive project management and issue tracking system that enables teams to plan, track, and manage their work efficiently. Through its robust API, it offers extensive capabilities for issue management, user administration, and workflow automation. `SmythOS` provides dedicated components designed to streamline the integration with `Jira Cloud Platform`, offering seamless access to Jira's powerful features directly from your workflows.

## Integration Settings

#### Base64 Encoded User Email and API Token

To use Jira Cloud Platform integration in `SmythOs`, you must authenticate each integration component with a base64 encoded user email and API token combo. Follow these steps to prepare your credentials:

1. **Generate API Token**: Generate an API token for Jira using your [Atlassian Account](https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens).
2. **Encode to Base64**: Follow the steps below:
   - Combine your user email and API Token in the format `useremail:api_token`.
   - Use the Encode/Decode component in SmythOS to encode this string to Base64. (Refer to the [Encode/Decode documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/FEncDec) for more details).
3. **Copy the `Base64 encoded useremail and api token`** and enter it into the settings section of the component.

> **Note:** Treat the `Base64 encoded useremail and api token` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
