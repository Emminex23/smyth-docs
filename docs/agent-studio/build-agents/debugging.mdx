# Debugging Guide

SmythOS provides comprehensive debugging tools to help you test, troubleshoot, and optimize your agent workflows. This guide covers the core debugging features and best practices.

---

## Debug Toolbar

The debug toolbar enables component-level debugging and workflow inspection. When activated, you can select individual components to examine their execution.

### Debug Controls

The toolbar provides essential execution controls:

- • **Debug Mode** - Activates component debugging capabilities
- • **Step** - Executes the selected component once
- • **Run/Pause** - Controls continuous workflow execution
- • **Stop** - Terminates the current debug session
- • **Attach** - Allows you to debug requests made from external debugging tools within SmythOS 

Note: If a debug session becomes unresponsive, reload the page to regain control.

### Component Inspection

When debugging is enabled:
1. Select a component to inspect
2. Hover over the component to view:
    - • Input values
    - • Output values 
    - • Current state
    - • Execution status
3. Check component logs for detailed execution information

## Component Testing

### Form Preview

Form Preview is a powerful testing feature designed specifically for testing agent skills:

1. **Purpose**: Form Preview allows you to test a complete agent skill (workflow) from start to finish
2. **Location**: The Form Preview button is located in the Agent Skill component, which is the first component in every workflow
3. **How it works**: 
   - Each workflow or skill in SmythOS agents functions as an API endpoint, represented by the Agent Skill component
   - When you click the Form Preview button, the system generates a form with all the necessary inputs required to run the entire skill/workflow
   - This generates a UI that mimics how the skill would be called as an API endpoint

4. **Testing process**:
   - The system automatically generates test values for all required input fields
   - You can optionally modify these pre-filled values if needed
   - Click "Run" to execute the entire workflow
   - View the complete output of the agent skill execution
   
5. **Benefits**:
   - Test your agent skill functionality before deployment
   - Quickly validate the entire workflow execution path
   - Identify and troubleshoot issues in your skill implementation
   - Verify that inputs are properly processed throughout the workflow

The Form Preview feature is essential for ensuring your agent skills work as expected before making them available through your deployed agent.

### Inspect Panel

The Inspect panel provides powerful debugging capabilities similar to browser developer tools. Access it by clicking the "Inspect" button at the bottom of the builder page.

The Inspect panel contains three tabs that offer different debugging perspectives:

#### Logs Tab

The Logs tab displays detailed execution logs when an agent is run in debug mode:
- • View chronological execution logs for each component
- • Track the complete flow of data through your workflow
- • Identify errors and exceptions during execution
- • Understand the sequence of component activations

This tab is particularly useful for tracing execution paths and diagnosing logical errors in your workflows.

#### Network Tab

The Network tab provides a detailed timeline view of component executions, similar to a browser's network inspector:
- • Visualize component execution sequence with a timeline view
- • See a complete list of executed components with execution times
- • Click on any component to view detailed execution information:
  - • Input values received
  - • Output values produced
  - • Execution duration
  - • Execution status
- • For components that consume credits (like WebSearch, Web Scrape, NodeJS, etc.):
  - • An icon appears next to these components indicating they contain cost information
  - • When clicking on these components, the estimated cost is displayed in the details section
  - • This allows real-time monitoring of resource usage during development

A particularly useful feature is the ability to **highlight components in the canvas** directly from the network tab, helping you quickly locate specific components in complex workflows.

#### Source Tab

The Source tab displays the complete agent structure in JSON format:
- • View the underlying JSON representation of your agent
- • Examine agent configuration details including:
  - • Name and description
  - • Behavioral settings
  - • Component definitions
  - • Connection configurations
  - • Authentication methods
  - • Global variables

This tab is valuable for understanding the complete agent structure and for advanced debugging scenarios where you need to inspect the raw configuration.

#### Using the Inspect Panel Effectively

For optimal debugging with the Inspect panel:
1. **Enable Debug Mode** before execution to capture detailed logs
2. Use the **Logs tab** to understand the execution flow
3. Examine the **Network tab** to identify performance bottlenecks and credit consumption
4. Reference the **Source tab** when troubleshooting configuration issues
5. Use the highlight feature in the Network tab to locate components in complex workflows

Combined with the other debugging tools covered in this guide, the Inspect panel provides comprehensive visibility into your agent's behavior and performance.

## Error Handling

### Error Output Configuration

The `_error` output provides structured error handling:

```json
{
    "message": "Error description",
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "details": {
        "component": "ComponentName",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

Key features:
- • Not present by default - must be manually added
- • Reserved name for consistent error handling
- • Automatically captures execution errors when present

## Best Practices

1. **Component Testing**
   - • Test components individually before testing the full workflow
   - • Verify input/output data types match expectations
   - • Use step execution for complex component interactions
   - • For API-dependent workflows, use the [Mock Data](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call#step-5-enable-mock-mode) feature to test without actual API keys.

2. **Error Handling**
   - • Implement `_error` outputs for critical components
   - • Monitor component logs during debugging sessions
   - • Handle edge cases explicitly

3. **Workflow Optimization**
   - • Inspect component execution times
   - • Identify bottlenecks through component logs
   - • Consider caching for frequently accessed data
