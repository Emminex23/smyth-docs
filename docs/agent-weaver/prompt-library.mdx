# Prompt Library

Weaver can build agents directly from your instructions. Each prompt is written to be immediately useful: you can copy it into Weaver, provide the inputs, and see a working workflow appear on the Canvas.  

- Starter prompts help you see quick results.  
- Category prompts show how to solve real tasks across marketing, research, education, business, and legal workflows.  

Each prompt follows best prompting techniques:  
- Clear **role assignment**  
- Defined **inputs**  
- Logical **process steps**  
- Structured **outputs**  

<InfoCallout title="Inputs Weaver understands">
Weaver can use text, URLs, or diagrams as inputs. For example, some prompts here accept a keyword, some a website URL, and others a workflow image. This flexibility lets you start in whatever way is most natural for your task.
