# WordPress *.ORG* Integration

`WordPress .ORG` is an open-source content management system (CMS) that allows you to host and build websites. WordPress stores your content and enables you to create and manage websites through a user-friendly dashboard, which offers thousands of plugins and themes. Unlike WordPress.com, `WordPress .ORG` gives you full control over your siteâ€™s appearance and functionality.

At `SmythOS`, we have fully integrated `WordPress .ORG` capabilities within our platform, providing custom components that facilitate the seamless incorporation of its extensive features into your software solutions. This integration allows developers to leverage the robust capabilities of WordPress directly from `SmythOS`, enhancing productivity and streamlining web development processes.
