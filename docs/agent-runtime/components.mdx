# SRE Components Reference

The Smyth Runtime Environment offers a vast set of over 40 production-ready components. These building blocks help you construct powerful and flexible [AI agents](/docs/agent-runtime/building-agents).

<InfoCallout title="At a glance">
Components are organized by their role in your agent workflows, making it easy to find the right tool for the job.

## AI & LLM Components

These components provide direct access to AI models and advanced language processing:

- `GenAILLM` — Integrate with multiple LLM providers through a unified interface.
- `VisionLLM` — Analyze and interpret images using AI.
- `MultimodalLLM` — Process text, images, and audio inputs together.
- `LLMAssistant` — Build conversational AI assistants with context awareness.
- `HuggingFace` — Access Hugging Face model hubs and APIs.
- `ImageGenerator` — Generate images based on textual prompts.

## External Integrations

Components that connect your agents to external data sources and services:

- `APICall` — Make HTTP API requests, supporting OAuth authentication.
- `WebSearch` — Perform web searches to retrieve up-to-date information.
- `WebScrape` — Extract content from websites for analysis.
- `ZapierAction` — Trigger workflows and automations via Zapier.
- `MCPClient` — Communicate using the Model Context Protocol.

## Data Processing Components

Help your agent organize, clean, and interpret data:

- `DataSourceIndexer` — Index large document collections for fast lookup.
- `DataSourceLookup` — Search and retrieve relevant data from sources.
- `DataSourceCleaner` — Normalize and clean data inputs.
- `JSONFilter` — Manipulate JSON-formatted data structures.
- `Classifier` — Categorize content into defined classes.

## Logic & Control Flow

Control the decision-making and flow of your agent’s tasks:

- `LogicAND`, `LogicOR`, `LogicXOR` — Perform boolean logic operations.
- `LogicAtLeast`, `LogicAtMost` — Conditional logic based on thresholds.
- `ForEach` — Iterate over lists and execute workflows repeatedly.
- `Async`, `Await` — Manage asynchronous operations within workflows.

## Storage & File Operations

Components focused on managing files and code execution:

- `FileStore` — Read, write, and manage files within your agent environment.
- `Code` — Execute custom code snippets dynamically.
- `ServerlessCode` — Run serverless functions for scalable logic.

## System Integration

Connect your agent to system-level features and plugins:

- `ComputerUse` — Automate system and computer interactions.
- `GPTPlugin` — Integrate OpenAI plugin capabilities.
- `APIEndpoint` — Create custom HTTP API endpoints within your agent.
