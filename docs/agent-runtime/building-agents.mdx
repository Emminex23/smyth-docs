# Building Agents with SRE

> Build agents your way—with no-code, code, or both. SRE adapts to your style, not the other way around.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">  
Whether you prefer visual workflows, programmatic logic, or a mix of both, SRE gives you full control and flexibility to design agents the way you want. Rapid prototyping, deep customization, live debugging; it’s all supported.
</InfoCallout>

## Pick Your Workflow

You can build agents using either [Agent Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview), the [Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide), or both. Choose what fits your use case—or [combine them](/docs/agent-runtime/hybrid-workflows) for hybrid flexibility.

### [Studio (Visual Builder)](#studio-visual-builder)

- Drag and drop components  
- Visually connect steps in your agent’s flow  
- Ideal for low-code teams, fast iteration, and cross-functional collaboration  
- Built-in testing, logging, and monitoring  

→ Explore [Agent Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)

### [SDK (Code-first)](#sdk-programming)

- Write and connect components using TypeScript  
- Build advanced workflows with custom logic  
- Type-safe, version-controlled, and CI/CD friendly  

→ See [SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)

## Hybrid Workflows

SRE supports full [hybrid workflows](/docs/agent-runtime/hybrid-workflows), letting you switch between Studio and SDK anytime.

- Start in Studio and export a `.smyth` file to use in SDK
- Build in SDK and visualize or test in Studio
- Transfer logic seamlessly without losing metadata

<InfoCallout title="Use Studio + SDK together">
Design visually for speed, extend in code for power. Hybrid workflows give you the best of both.
</InfoCallout>

## Studio (Visual Builder)

Studio is SRE’s no-code visual environment. It’s great for building agents collaboratively, fast.

### What you can do

- Design logic with drag-and-drop blocks  
- Wire inputs and outputs by drawing connections  
- Add LLMs, APIs, data sources, logic, or tools from the [Component Library](/docs/agent-runtime/components)  
- Test, debug, and monitor everything right in the canvas

→ Try the [Studio Quickstart](/docs/agent-studio/quickstart/quickstart)

## SDK Programming

The SDK is for builders who want full control in code.

### Key Benefits

- TypeScript-based and fully type-safe  
- Supports advanced logic, async ops, and custom components  
- Integrates seamlessly with your dev stack (VS Code, Git, CI, etc.)

### Agent Example (Programmatic Flow)

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "sourceId": "llm_1",
      "targetId": "classifier_1",
      "sourceIndex": 0,
      "targetIndex": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

> This structure defines a visual connection: an LLM's output flows into a classifier. Studio generates this behind the scenes—but you can inspect or export it too.

### SDK Equivalent

```javascript
const llm = SDK.GenAILLM({ model: 'gpt-4' }, agent);
const classifier = SDK.Classifier({ classes: ['positive', 'negative'] }, agent);

// Programmatically link them
classifier.in({ Input: llm.out.Reply });
```

## Custom Components and Skills

Want to go beyond what’s in the box? You can.

### Custom Components

Create reusable logic blocks by extending the base component class:

```typescript
export class MyCustomComponent extends Component {
  async process(input, config, agent) {
    // Your custom logic here
    return { result: processedData };
  }
}
```

→ See [how components work](/docs/agent-runtime/components)

### Agent Skills (aka tools)

You can expose custom logic as callable skills that agents use at runtime:

```typescript
const weatherSkill = agent.addSkill({
  name: 'getWeather',
  description: 'Get current weather for a location',
  ai_exposed: true,
  process: async (location) => {
    return { temperature: 72, condition: 'sunny' };
  },
});
```

## Real-time Monitoring & Debugging

No matter how you build, SRE helps you see what’s going on inside your agents:

- Live updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)  
- Logs and trace results per component  
- Step-by-step debug mode  
- Dashboards for memory, tokens, and performance  

→ Monitor agents via [Studio Debugging Tools](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging)

## Hybrid Workflows

You don’t have to choose between code and canvas. Use both—at the same time.

- Start building in Studio, then extend with SDK  
- Use Studio for workflows and SDK for custom skills  
- Export/import component graphs to toggle between modes
