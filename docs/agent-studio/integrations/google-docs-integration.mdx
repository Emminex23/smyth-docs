# Google Docs Integration

`Google Docs` is a versatile web-based application from Google that provides robust capabilities for creating, editing, and collaborating on documents directly within a browser, without needing traditional desktop software. It forms part of the broader Google Workspace suite, enabling users to efficiently format text, insert imagery, and manage complex tables, among other features. The platform facilitates real-time collaboration, with features like automatic saving and comprehensive revision histories that enhance productivity and facilitate version control.

Integrating `Google Docs` into `SmythOS` significantly enhances user efficiency by melding document management with automated operational workflows. This integration supports real-time document access and editing within `SmythOS`, allowing users to seamlessly bridge their informational and operational environments without the need to switch platforms. It not only streamlines communication and project tracking but also leverages Google's robust security protocols to ensure that all data handled is secure. For businesses, this means optimized productivity, improved collaborative capabilities, and enhanced data security, all within a single, unified system.

## Google OAuth Setup

> **Note:** Like many components of `SmythOS`, you can extend this list by adding new inputs with the `+` button in the `Inputs` section.

### Outputs

Upon successful execution, the component delivers detailed outputs that help in further processing:

1. **Response**: Contains the full JSON response from the `Google Docs` API, providing the latest document data.
2. **Headers**: HTTP headers returned by the API call that can offer additional information about the request and response.
3. **title**: Extracts the title of the document from the response data.
4. **content**: Retrieves the full content of the document in a structured format.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.

## Append Text

#### Client ID & Client Secret

For a visual step-by-step guide, watch this [video](#google-oauth-setup).

For seamless integration of `Google Docs` with `SmythOS`, obtaining secure credentials such as a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret` is essential. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you acquire these credentials:

1. **Visit the Google Developers Console**:
   - Navigate to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or select an existing project that is appropriate for your needs.

2. **Enable the Google Docs API**:
   - Proceed to the `Library` section within the Developers Console.
   - Search for the `Google Docs API` and enable it for your selected project.

3. **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen**:
   - Fill in the required details such as your application's name, email address, and the scopes necessary for your application on the consent screen settings.

4. **Create Credentials**:
   - Go to the `Credentials` tab in the console.
   - Click `Create credentials`, then select `OAuth client ID`.
   - Choose the application type that matches your usage scenario.
   - Remember to specify the callback URL as `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/google/callback` to ensure proper redirection after authentication.

5. **Retrieve Client ID and Client Secret**:
   - Once the OAuth client ID is configured, the system will provide you with a `Client ID` and a `Client Secret`.

6. **Enter and Authenticate**:
   - Enter these credentials into the relevant fields in the SmythOS settings for the Google Docs component.
   - Click on the `Authenticate` button to establish a secure connection, allowing you to utilize Google Docs within SmythOS efficiently.

> **Note:** Treat the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
