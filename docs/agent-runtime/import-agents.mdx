# Import Studio Agents into SRE

If you’ve created an agent in **[SmythOS Studio (Visual Canvas)](/docs/agent-studio/overview)**, you don’t need to rebuild it to run locally. Export the agent as a `.smyth` file, add a `default_model`, and run it inside the **[SmythOS Runtime Environment (SRE)](/docs/agent-runtime/overview)**.  

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
This workflow lets you design visually in Studio, then bring your agent into SRE with almost no changes. If you create your project with examples enabled, you’ll also get a ready-to-use <code>terminalChat</code> helper for testing.
</InfoCallout>

This guide shows you the quickest path: export, add a `default_model`, import the `.smyth` into SRE, and test it with **Terminal Chat**.

## Before you start

Before you import your Studio agent into SRE, make sure you have the right setup:

- You’ll need to be able to open your workflow in the **[SmythOS Studio builder](https://app.smythos.com/builder)** so you can export it.  
- On your machine, have **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** installed and the **[SRE CLI set up](/docs/agent-runtime/quickstart)**.  
- If your agent uses LLM-based components, keep your API key for OpenAI, Anthropic, or another provider handy.  

And if you’re new to building visually, you can take a quick look at the **[Studio Canvas guide](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas)** before you go further.

<TipCallout title="Fastest path">
When you create a new SRE project, choose **examples**. It comes with a ready-to-use <code>terminalChat</code> helper so you can test your agent instantly.

## Step 1. Export your agent from Studio

Open your agent in Studio and export it as a `.smyth` file.  

For example, you might have a simple agent skill named `test` that takes a `name` and echoes back `Hello, <name>`.

<TipCallout title="Shortcut">
Use <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + E</kbd> on Windows/Linux or <kbd>⌘ + Shift + E</kbd> on macOS to export quickly.
</TipCallout>

## Step 2. Add the required default_model

SRE requires the `.smyth` file to include a `default_model`. This field is missing in Studio exports, so you’ll need to add it manually.

<WarningCallout title="Required for import">
Without <code>default_model</code>, SRE cannot import your agent.
</WarningCallout>

Here’s what you need to add:

```json
{
  "default_model": "gpt-4.o"
}
```

Replace `"gpt-4o"` with the LLM you plan to use, such as `"gpt-5"` or `"claude-3-sonnet"`.

## Step 3. Import the .smyth file into SRE

Next, bring your exported agent into your SRE project.

1. Copy your `.smyth` file into the SRE project folder.  
2. Create a new file (for example, `myAgent.ts`) and import the agent:

```ts
import { agentImport } from "sre/agent";

const agentPath = "./myAgent.smyth";
export const myAgent = agentImport(agentPath);
```

<Spacer size="md" />

## Step 4. Test the agent with Terminal Chat

Once imported, you can quickly test the agent with the built-in Terminal Chat helper.

In your `index.ts` file:

```ts
import { terminalChat } from "./terminalChat";
import { myAgent } from "./myAgent";

terminalChat(myAgent);
```

Then run the project:

```bash
$ npm start
? Enter session ID: demo-session
> Hello Raul
< Hello Raul`
```

<TipCallout title="Keep context between runs">
Reuse the same session ID with <code>persist: true</code> if you want the agent to remember earlier messages.
</TipCallout>

## Component compatibility in SRE

Not every Studio component works in SRE. Here’s a quick compatibility table:

| Component | SRE status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GenAI LLM | <Badge type="supported">Supported</Badge> | Works with your provider API key |
| LLM Assistant | <Badge type="supported">Supported</Badge> | Default choice for chat style workflows |
| Classifier | <Badge type="supported">Supported</Badge> | Uses your LLM provider |
| Image Generator | <Badge type="supported">Supported</Badge> | Feature set depends on provider |
| Web Search | <Badge type="not supported">Not supported</Badge> | Studio credit based |
| Web Scrape | <Badge type="not supported">Not supported</Badge> | Studio credit based |
| Node.js component | <Badge type="not supported">Not supported</Badge> | Use local code or <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a> scripts alongside SRE |

<InfoCallout title="Adapting unsupported components">
If your agent uses unsupported nodes, replace them with SRE-friendly alternatives. For example, use an LLM call with custom fetch logic instead of Web Search.

## FAQs

<InfoCallout title="Common Questions" collapsible defaultCollapsed>

**Do I always need to add <code>default_model</code>?**  
Yes. Adding it directly to the `.smyth` file is the simplest way to make sure SRE imports correctly.

**Which model should I use for testing?**  
Any general LLM works, such as <code>gpt-4o</code> or <code>claude-3-sonnet</code>. Use the one your team already relies on.

**Why does my agent not remember earlier messages?**  
Session persistence depends on the session ID. Reuse the same ID and enable persistence in <code>terminalChat</code>.

**My Studio agent includes Web Search or Scraping. What now?**  
Those features are not supported in SRE. Replace or mock them for local testing.

**Can I update the agent after importing?**  
Yes. Update in Studio, re-export as `.smyth`, and re-import into your project.
