# Deployments with SmythOS

> **Build once ➜ run anywhere.**  
> SmythOS gives you three deployment modes; pick what fits your workflow today and upgrade later without code changes.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Agent Cloud for most users, Enterprise for regulated environments, Local Runtime for devs and air-gapped POCs.
</InfoCallout>

## Understanding Your Deployment Options

SmythOS supports three distinct deployment paths; each is designed to match a different stage of development or production use case. Here's how to choose:

- **Agent Cloud**: Perfect for most users. It’s fast, managed, and requires zero infra knowledge.
- **Enterprise Deployments**: Tailored for organizations with strict security, compliance, or hosting needs.
- **Local Runtime**: Great for isolated dev/testing environments or air-gapped prototypes.

## Deployment Modes Explained

| Mode              | Infrastructure     | Who It's For           | Highlights                               | How to Access                         |

## The 3 Main Options to Deploy Agent

Choose your deployment method through the `Deploy` button in the top right corner:

## Agent Cloud: Fastest Way to Go Live

Deploy your agent to **SmythOS-hosted infrastructure**, which is ideal for most use cases if you don't want to worry about infrastruture. It offers:

* **No setup required** — preconfigured with staging domains like `youragent.agent.pstage.smyth.ai`
* **Auto-provisioned SSL** - secure HTTPS served instantly
* **Autoscaling built-in** - handles load without extra steps

### Why Use Agent Cloud?
- You don’t want to worry about servers, scaling, or SSL certificates.
- You want to deploy instantly to a shareable live URL.
- You want free infrastructure for testing or lightweight production use.

### Optional: Use Your Own Domain

You can point your custom domain to SmythOS in three simple steps:

1. Go to [Subdomains](https://app.smythos.com/domains)
2. Click **Add Subdomain** and enter the subdomain (e.g., `test.smyth.com`)
3. You'll receive DNS instructions — create a **CNAME** record:
   - **Host**: `test.smyth.com`
   - **Target**: `b3830d6590893c02fbab61b0e08b4f8c.proxy.stage.smyth.ai`
4. Click **Verify** after setting your DNS. It may take up to 24 hours for DNS changes to propagate.

## Enterprise Deployments

SmythOS supports highly customized deployments for organizations that need full control:

* On-premise or private VPC hosting
* Advanced network + data security
* Seamless LLM integration via custom endpoints
* Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) available

<WarningCallout>
Enterprise plans are not self-service. Please [contact Sales](mailto:sales@smythos.com) to discuss deployment options.

## Local Runtime

Use **Smyth Runtime Local (SRL)** for local testing and development. It is fast, private, and offline.

<InfoCallout>
**Use case:** When you need to test workflows in isolated environments or run proof-of-concept demos with zero internet.
</InfoCallout>

### How to Deploy Locally

1. Click `Export Agent` in Builder (`Ctrl + Shift + E` or `Cmnd + Shift + E`)
2. Save the exported `agent.json`
3. Download SRL: [GitHub → Smyth Runtime Local](https://github.com/Smyth-ai/smyth-runtime-local)
4. Run your agent locally:

```bash
srl run agent.json
```

<WarningCallout>
If you need local model inference or full API capabilities, please follow updates in [our GitHub](https://github.com/Smyth-ai/smyth-runtime-local) issue tracker.
</WarningCallout>

## Versioning & Changelog

Every deployment is **semantic-versioned** (`Major.Minor`).

- **Major** = breaking workflow changes
- **Minor** = additive or bug-fix updates

Release notes are **optional but recommended** — users see them in **Agent Settings → Deployments**.

## Deployment Quick-Start (Agent Cloud)

Follow these steps to get your agent live in minutes:

1. Click **Deploy** in the builder header.
2. Choose **Agent Cloud** tab.
3. Enter version number (e.g. `1.0`).
4. Pick a **Test Subdomain** or your **custom domain**.
5. (Optional) Add **release notes** (we recommend it so you can document your releases).
6. Hit **Deploy**.

> **Boom.** Just like that, SmythOS provisions SSL, runs health checks, and returns a live URL.
