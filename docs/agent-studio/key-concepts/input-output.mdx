# Inputs and Outputs in Studio

In Studio, every workflow runs on the movement of **inputs and outputs (I/O)**. Components take in data through inputs, process it, and send results through outputs. Understanding how ports work ensures your agents run reliably at scale.

<InfoCallout title="Quick Reference">
● = required input, ○ = optional input  
Blue = outputs, Red = inputs  
Always connect **blue → red**
</InfoCallout>

## Why I/O Matters

Inputs and outputs are the backbone of Studio workflows. If a required input is missing, execution halts. If outputs are miswired, downstream components fail or return empty data. Designing clear I/O paths makes your agents predictable and easier to debug.

If you’re new to the layout, start with the [Studio Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas) to see how ports appear visually.

## Port Symbols

| Symbol | Port Colour | Meaning |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **● Solid** | Red input | Required — execution stops until this is filled |
| **○ Hollow** | Red input | Optional — used only if data is provided |
| **● Solid** | Blue output | Main result passed forward |
| **○ Hollow** | Blue output | Secondary or derived result |

## Supported Input Types

Studio supports a wide range of input categories and structured subtypes. These cover everything from plain text prompts to files, arrays, and objects.

### Main Categories

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Text** | Freeform strings or prompts |
| **Image** | Upload or process PNG, JPG, SVG |
| **Audio** | Process speech or audio files |
| **Video** | Work with video metadata or clips |
| **Structured** | JSON, arrays, objects, or schema-based formats |

### Structured Subtypes

| Subtype | Example | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| `string` | `"Translate this to French"` | Most common type |
| `number` | `3.14` | Decimal or float |
| `integer` | `42` | Whole number |
| `boolean` | `true` | On/off, yes/no toggles |
| `array` | `["item1", "item2"]` | Useful for batching |
| `object` | `{ "id": 1, "name": "Alice" }` | Flexible structured payload |
| `binary` | PNG, CSV | Stored and returned as signed URL |
| `date` | `2025-01-01` | ISO 8601 format |
| `any` | Flexible fallback (not validated) |

## Chaining Data Between Components

The rule is simple: **blue output → red input**.

- Outputs can feed multiple inputs downstream  
- Optional inputs (○ red) are used only when a value is present  
- Use transformer components when output and input formats don’t match  

For examples of transformers and connectors, see the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components).

## Execution Rules

Studio determines when a component runs based on its inputs:

- **Runs** → all required inputs are connected and resolved  
- **Waits** → one or more required inputs are missing  
- **Skips** → required input missing and no fallback provided  

This execution model prevents components from firing without the data they need.

<InfoCallout title="Debugging I/O in Studio">
If a component stays red, it usually means a required input is missing or wired incorrectly. Use [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs) and [Debugging with Weaver](/docs/agent-weaver/debugging-agents) to inspect what’s happening.

## Best Practices for I/O

- Keep outputs small and scoped to only what’s needed downstream  
- Test I/O paths incrementally with simple inputs before scaling up  
- Use Notes or color-coded components to document sections of your flow  
- Save real-world test inputs to re-run whenever you modify a workflow  

<TipCallout title="Pro Tip">
A clear I/O design makes it easier to move between Weaver and Studio. You can start an agent in Weaver and refine it in Studio without losing clarity on how data flows.
