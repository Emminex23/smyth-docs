# Quickstart Guide

This quickstart walks you through building your first working agent in SmythOS. You’ll use the [Lead Enrichment Agent](/docs/agent-templates/sales/lead-enrichment-agent) template, which gathers public data to enrich lead profiles with actionable insights.

## Step 1: Remix a Template

1. From the Studio, open the **[Templates](https://app.smythos.com/templates)** section in the top navigation.  
2. Switch to the **Sales** tab.  
3. Find the **Lead Enrichment Agent** and click **Remix**.

## Step 2: Run the Agent with Form Preview

Next, test your agent by providing some input. SmythOS offers several options such as Chat, API, LLM, and MCp. For this guide, we’ll use Form Preview, which lets you enter required fields and run the workflow.

You can open Form Preview in two ways:  

### Option A: From the top toolbar
1. Click **Test** in the top-right toolbar.  
2. Switch to the **Form Preview** tab.  
3. Enter sample details.  
4. Click **Run** to execute the workflow.  

### Option B: From the canvas
1. Click the **Form Preview** button on the block you want to test.

2. Provide inputs. Provide inputs. You can either enter your own details or use this sample to quickly run the agent:

<PromptCard
  title="Sample Lead Enrichment Input"
  prompt={`Full name: Aria Smyth
Email: ariathesmyth@smythos.com
Company name: SmythOS`}
/>

<Image src="/docs/img/lead_enrichment_agent/gif_1.gif" alt="Fill in inputs and run the form" />  

3. Click **Run** and the agent will return a structured lead profile.

<InfoCallout title="No API Keys Yet?">
If your agent includes an [API Call component](/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/api-call), you can enable **Mock Mode** to test it with sample data before adding real keys.  
This is useful for experimenting without setting up integrations right away.

## Step 3: Deploy Your Agent

Once your agent runs successfully, you can deploy it from Studio.  

Once your agent runs as expected, deploy it:

1. Click **Deploy** in the workspace header.  
2. Choose your environment: **Agent Cloud**, **Enterprise**, or **Local Runtime**.
3. Use [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs) to monitor execution history and debug if needed.  

If you want to make your agent accessible under a branded domain, see the [Subdomains guide](/docs/agent-deployments/subdomains).

## What’s Next

You now have a working agent. From here, you can explore the rest of the SmythOS platform:

- Use [Weaver](/docs/agent-weaver/overview) for building agents conversationally from prompts.  
- Switch to [Studio Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas) for visual editing and advanced workflows.  
- Learn about the [Runtime](/docs/agent-runtime/overview) to see how agents run in production.  
- Review [Deployments](/docs/agent-deployments/overview) to publish your agent to users securely.
