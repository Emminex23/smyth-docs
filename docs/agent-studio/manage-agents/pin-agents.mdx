# Pinned Agents

The **Pin Agents** feature lets you keep your most important agents at the top of the agent list.  
Pinned agents are visible first, no matter how the list is sorted.

<InfoCallout title="Why pin agents?">
Pinning makes frequently used or high-priority agents quick to find and consistent for your whole team.

## How Pinning Works

- Pinned agents always appear **above unpinned agents** after you refilter or refresh the dashboard.  
- Within the pinned group, agents follow the current sort option (e.g., sort by name).  
- Unpinned agents are listed below, sorted normally.

## How It Works For Your Team

Pinning is **shared with everyone on your team**. If you pin something and your teammate pins something else, both will show up pinned for the whole team.

**Example:**

- You pin 1 agent
- Your teammate pins 2 different agents
- Both of you will see all 3 pinned agents at the top

This way, no important agent gets missed by anyone on the team.

## Tips For Using Pinned Agents

- Pin agents you use a lot, share across workflows, or rely on for critical tasks
- Use sorting (alphabetical, date, etc.) to make your pinned agents even easier to scan
