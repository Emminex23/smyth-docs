# Getting started with SRE

> Ready to build your first AI agent? This guide walks you through the essential steps to install, configure, and run an agent with Smyth Runtime Environment.

<InfoCallout>
**What you’ll accomplish:**  
- Install Smyth Runtime Environment  
- Initialize the runtime  
- Create and run a simple AI agent  
</InfoCallout>

## Installation

Begin by installing the Smyth Runtime package via npm:

```bash
npm install smyth-runtime
```

## Initialize the runtime

Import and initialize SRE in your project. Use a simple configuration for local development:

```typescript
import { SRE, SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';

const sre = SRE.init({
  Cache: { Connector: 'RAM' },
  Storage: { Connector: 'Local' },
  Log: { Connector: 'ConsoleLog' },
});

await sre.ready();
```

This sets up in-memory caching, local file storage, and console logging — a good starting point.

## Create an LLM instance

Create an instance of a language model to generate AI responses:

```typescript
const llm = new SDK.LLM('OpenAI', { model: 'gpt-4' });
```

## Run a simple prompt

Send a prompt to your model and log the response:

```typescript
const response = await llm.prompt('Hello, world!');
console.log(response);
```

## Stream responses

For interactive applications, stream output as it’s generated:

```typescript
const eventEmitter = await llm.prompt('Write a short story').stream();
eventEmitter.on('content', (chunk) => process.stdout.write(chunk));
```

## What’s next?

Once comfortable with this setup, explore:

- Creating custom agents with the SDK  
- Designing visual workflows  
- Integrating data sources and APIs  
- Scaling from local development to production
