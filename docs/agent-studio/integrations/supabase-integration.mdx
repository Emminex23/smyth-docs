# Supabase Integration

`Supabase` is a company that provides an open-source alternative to Firebase, focusing on providing developers with a suite of tools and services to build scalable applications. It offers a range of features, including real-time databases, authentication, file storage, and more, all while leveraging the power of PostgreSQL.

At `SmythOS`, we prioritize seamless integration with `Supabase`, enriching its robust features with tailor-made components to streamline integration within your agents' workflow.

## List Projects

Retrieve a list of `Supabase` projects using the `List Projects` component.

### Settings

To initialize and configure the `List Projects` component, follow these simple guidelines:

1. If you haven't already, register for an account on the `Supabase` platform to access its database services.
2. Navigate to the [Access Tokens](https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens) section in your `Supabase` dashboard.
3. Generate your `API Key` by following the provided instructions.
4. Return to the settings of the component and input your generated `API Key` into the specified section designated for API integration.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.
