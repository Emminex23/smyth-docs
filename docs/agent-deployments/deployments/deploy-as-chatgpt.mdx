## When to Use ChatGPT Deployment in SmythOS?

Deploying as ChatGPT allows you to connect your SmythOS agent with a custom GPT inside ChatGPT. By importing the OpenAPI schema generated by SmythOS, you can expose your agent's capabilities as **actions** that ChatGPT can call on demand.

This creates powerful use cases:

- Extend ChatGPT with your domain-specific logic  
- Let users interact with your workflows via natural language  
- Control agent behavior via secure, versioned APIs

## Prerequisites

Before you start, youâ€™ll need:

- A deployed SmythOS agent (Test or Production)
- Access to [OpenAI GPT Builder](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor) (Pro or higher)

## Step 1: Copy Your Agent's OpenAPI URL

Your Agent's OpenAPI schema is the bridge to ChatGPT. It's a JSON file that tells GPT Builder what your Agent can do.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to your Agent's **Settings â†’ Deployments**.
2.  Under the **Environment URLs** section, copy the subdomain for your chosen environment.

```text
https://[your-agent].agent.stage.smyth.ai
```

```text
https://[your-agent].agent.pstage.smyth.ai
```

3.  Create the full OpenAPI URL by appending `/api-docs/openapi-llm.json` to the subdomain you copied.

```url
https://[your-agent].agent.pstage.smyth.ai/api-docs/openapi-llm.json
```

<TipCallout title="Test vs. Production Environment">
Use the **Test** URL for development and iteration, as it always reflects your latest unpublished draft. Use the **Production** URL for stable, public-facing GPTs.
</TipCallout>

## Step 2: Build Your Custom GPT

### 1. Open GPT Builder
[Click here to open GPT Builder](https://chat.openai.com/gpts/editor)

### 2. Set Basic Configuration
Click the **Configure** tab.

### 3. Add Name, Instructions, and Welcome Message
Fill in:
- **Name** â€“ the public-facing name of your GPT
- **Instructions** â€“ paste your SmythOS agent behavior or prompt config
- **Welcome message** â€“ what users see on launch

<InfoCallout> For consistency, paste the same instructions or system prompt used in your agent. </InfoCallout> 

### 4. Add Your Agent as an Action

- Scroll to the Actions section
- Click Create new action
- Paste your OpenAPI URL (Test or Production):

#### Test Agent:
```text
https://your-agent.agent.stage.smyth.ai/api-docs/openapi-llm.json
```

#### Production Agent:
```text
https://your-agent.agent.pstage.smyth.ai/api-docs/openapi-llm.json
```

- Click **Import** to load the schema.

 The GPT Builder will fetch your agentâ€™s API definition and list available actions.

<InfoCallout title="URL Format Note">
Make sure the URL resolves directly to a `.json` file. If redirected, use the final URL.
</InfoCallout>

### 6. Save and Test

- Click Create in the top right to save your GPT
- Interact with it like any other GPT, but now powered by your SmythOS agent
- Optionally, share the GPT with others via a public link

<SuccessCallout title="Success">
Youâ€™ve connected your agent to ChatGPT! Your workflows now power a custom GPT.
</SuccessCallout>

## Keeping Your GPT Synced

<InfoCallout title="Live Sync with Test Mode">
If youâ€™re using a `stage` subdomain, your GPT reflects the latest edits. In debug mode, ChatGPT waits for manual approval in Studio.
</InfoCallout>

- **Re-deploy** your agent after edits
- **Re-check** your subdomain to ensure itâ€™s unchanged
- **Re-import** the OpenAPI URL in GPT Builder to sync new logic

<PromptCard prompt="Reimport your OpenAPI URL after every significant agent update or version bump." />

<Spacer size="md" />

## Whatâ€™s Next?

Great! Your SmythOS agent is now live and available inside ChatGPT as a custom GPT.

- Build different GPTs using the same backend logic
- Route traffic by versioning your agent and updating GPT URLs
- Monitor usage from **Settings â†’ Deployments â†’ Analytics** in SmythOS
