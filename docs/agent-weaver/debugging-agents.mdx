# Debug Agents with Weaver

Weaver gives you built-in tools to find, fix, and prevent errors without leaving chat or the Canvas. This guide walks you from quick fixes to deeper diagnosis, then prevention.

<InfoCallout title="Quick Fix Flow">
Click the red component, review its input and output snapshot, press **Fix with AI**, then rerun. Most problems resolve in under a minute.
</InfoCallout>

## Spot Problems Quickly

Component border colors show status during a run:

| Border Colour | Meaning | What To Do |
|---|---|---|
| üü¢ Green | Success | No action needed |
| üü° Yellow | Waiting for upstream | Inspect earlier components |
| üü† Orange | Missing required input | Connect the correct input or fill a field |
| ‚ö™ Grey | Still running | Let it complete |
| üî¥ Red | Failed | Start diagnosis |

<TipCallout title="Why This Works">
Weaver‚Äôs visual debugger and Canvas updates make it easy to ‚Äúsee where it broke‚Äù before you dive into details.
</TipCallout>

## Diagnose with Inputs and Outputs

Click any red component to open its inspector. You will see the **inputs the block received** and the **output or error** it produced. Look for:

- Empty or malformed inputs  
- 500-level API responses  
- Quota or rate-limit errors  
- JSON parsing failures  

Example diagnosis:

<PromptCard prompt="Input: { 'article': '' }  
Output: Error: Empty string cannot be processed" />

<InfoCallout title="Upstream vs Local Errors">
If inputs are wrong or empty, fix the upstream step or wiring. If inputs look fine, adjust this component‚Äôs configuration or prompt.
</InfoCallout>

<Spacer size="md" />

## Fix with AI

When the issue is prompt or parameter related, use **Fix with AI** on the failing block. Provide a short, direct instruction:

<PromptCard prompt="Article text exceeded 5000 characters. Trim to 800 characters and retry." />

Weaver updates the component‚Äôs prompt or parameters, reruns the block, and shows you what changed. If it stays red, refine your instruction and try again.

## Handle Cascading Failures

Select multiple components with **Cmd/Ctrl + click**, then rerun them in sequence. This helps when a bad output flows downstream and several blocks need to be re-executed together.

<InfoCallout title="Rollback">
If a series of changes made things worse, use the Revert and Reapply to revert to a clean state and try again.
</InfoCallout>

## Common Error Recipes

| Symptom | Likely Fix |
|---|---|
| **JSON parse error** | In the upstream LLM or transformer, constrain output to strict JSON and validate before passing forward. |
| **Quota or rate limit** | Insert a **Sleep** component between retries. You can pass a variable like `Retry-After` to wait exactly as required. |
| **Empty input** | Check Canvas wiring and ensure the expected upstream output is connected. |
| **Unexpected API format** | Normalize with a JSON Filter or transformer before the next step. |

<TipCallout title="Reference Components">
You will find **Sleep** for timed pauses, **JSON Filter** for shaping payloads, and other helpers in the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components).
</TipCallout>

## Prevent Tomorrow‚Äôs Bugs

- **Keep workflows modular** so each step is easy to test in isolation.  
- **Save real test inputs** and reuse them while iterating.  
- **Lean on linting** to catch prompt ambiguities, weak types, or missing auth early.  
- **Throttle retries with Sleep** to respect API limits and backoff policies.

<InfoCallout title="Sleep Component Tip">
Sleep can take a fixed duration or a variable such as an API‚Äôs `Retry-After` value, which makes rate-limit handling reliable.
</InfoCallout>

## Use Debug Mode and Logs

Turn on **Debug Mode** from the toolbar when you need deeper inspection. You will see:

- Execution timeline per component  
- Request and response payloads  
- Headers and runtime metadata  
- Parsed inputs and structured outputs  
- Model prompts and replies  
- Click-through trace from a log entry to the block on Canvas

Use the **Agent Activity Logs** to compare expected versus actual results across runs and to spot slow or flaky steps.

<InfoCallout title="Reading Logs Effectively">
Filter by run, jump to the failing block, and compare payloads before and after your fix to confirm the change worked.
</InfoCallout>

## When You Need Extra Help

- Export your agent and test it locally with the SmythOS runtime.  
- Share minimal repro steps and payloads in the Discord debugging channel.  
- Keep logs handy so others can help you pinpoint the failure quickly.

<WarningCallout title="Start Small">
Inspect the failing block first. Large, sweeping changes often mask the real issue and slow you down.
</WarningCallout>

# Next Steps

- See real prompts that trigger these patterns in the [Prompt Library](/docs/agent-weaver/prompt-library).  
- If you are new to Weaver, try the [Weaver Quickstart](/docs/agent-weaver/quickstart).  
- Browse the [Component Library](/docs/agent-studio/components) for Sleep, JSON tools, and other helpers.  
- Review your run history in [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs) whenever something feels off.
