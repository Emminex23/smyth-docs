# Microsoft Calendar Integration

`Microsoft Calendar` is a critical tool within the Microsoft 365 suite, offering robust features for managing schedules, appointments, and events. Seamlessly integrated with other Microsoft applications, it allows users to stay organized and on top of their daily tasks. In a business environment, `Microsoft Calendar` facilitates team collaboration through shared calendars and meeting scheduling.

Integrating `Microsoft Calendar` into `SmythOS` offers several advantages:
- **Collaboration**: Create calendars and schedule meetings with team members directly from `SmythOS`, enhancing productivity.
- **Centralization**: Manage all your appointments and schedules from within `SmythOS`, reducing the need to switch between multiple applications.

With `Microsoft Calendar` integration, `SmythOS` users can streamline their workflow by having all their scheduling needs met within one unified platform.

## Create Calendar

Create a new calendar in the default calendar group or a specified calendar group for a user in `Microsoft Calendar`.

#### Client ID & Client Secret

To kickstart this component, follow these initial steps to obtain your `Client ID` and `Client Secret` using Microsoft Entra:

1. **Register Your Application:**
   - Go to the [Microsoft Entra Portal](https://entra.microsoft.com/).
   - Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** and select **App registrations**.
   - Click on **New registration** to create a new application.

2. **Provide Application Details:**
   - **Name**: Enter a name for your application.
   - **Supported account types**: Choose the account types that you want to support. This can be:
     - Accounts in this organizational directory only
     - Accounts in any organizational directory
     - Accounts in any organizational directory and personal Microsoft accounts
   - **Redirect URI**: Select `Web` and enter `https://app.smythos.com/oauth/oauth2/callback` as the URI.
   - Click on **Register**.

3. **Obtain Client ID & Client Secret:**
   - **Client ID**: Once registered, go to the **Overview** section of your new application to find your `Client ID` (also known as the Application ID). Copy this value.
   - **Client Secret**:
     - Navigate to **Certificates & secrets**.
     - In the **Client secrets** section, click on **New client secret**.
     - Provide a description and choose an expiration period.
     - Click on **Add**.
     - Copy the client secret value displayed. This is your `Client Secret`. Ensure you copy it now because it will be hidden once you leave the page.

4. **Configure API Permissions:**
   - Go to the **API permissions** section.
   - Click on **Add a permission** and select **Microsoft Graph**.
   - Choose **Delegated permissions** if your app needs to authenticate as a signed-in user, or **Application permissions** if your app runs as a background service or daemon without user interaction.
   - Grant the following permissions as needed:
     - `Calendars.ReadWrite`
     - `offline_access`
   - Click on **Add permissions**.
   - Click on **Grant admin consent for [your organization]** to grant the permissions.

5. **Enter Credentials in SmythOS:**
   - Navigate to the settings section of the component in SmythOS.
   - Enter the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` that you obtained from the Microsoft Entra portal.
   - Click on the **Authenticate** button to connect the component to Microsoft Calendar.

> **Note:** Treat the `Client ID` & `Client Secret` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

#### ðŸ”‘ Authenticate/Sign Out Button

The component provides a versatile button designed to toggle between **Authenticate** and **Sign Out** based on the current authentication state within the OAuth setup.

- **Authenticate Button**: This button serves as an additional method to authenticate, complementing the main **Authenticate** button already present in the component.
- **Sign Out Button**: Allows users to sign out when they are currently authenticated.

This button serves a critical role in scenarios where the component cannot retrieve a valid token due to reasons such as:
- The token is invalid.
- The token has expired.
- Other token-related issues.

In such cases, you can use the combo action of signing out and authenticating again to resolve these token-related problems, ensuring seamless authentication management within your application.
