#### 🔑 Authenticate/Sign Out Button

The component provides a versatile button designed to toggle between **Authenticate** and **Sign Out** based on the current authentication state within the OAuth setup.

- **Authenticate Button**: This button serves as an additional method to authenticate, complementing the main **Authenticate** button already present in the component.
- **Sign Out Button**: Allows users to sign out when they are currently authenticated.

This button serves a critical role in scenarios where the component cannot retrieve a valid token due to reasons such as:
- The token is invalid.
- The token has expired.
- Other token-related issues.

In such cases, you can use the combo action of signing out and authenticating again to resolve these token-related problems, ensuring seamless authentication management within your application.

     - Navigate to **Certificates & secrets**.
     - In the **Client secrets** section, click on **New client secret**.
     - Provide a description and choose an expiration period.
     - Click on **Add**.
     - Copy the client secret value displayed. This is your `Client Secret`. Ensure you copy it now because it will be hidden once you leave the page.

4. **Configure API Permissions:**
   - Go to the **API permissions** section.
   - Click on **Add a permission** and select **Microsoft Graph**.
   - Choose **Delegated permissions** if your app needs to authenticate as a signed-in user, or **Application permissions** if your app runs as a background service or daemon without user interaction.

     - `Chat.Read`
     - `Chat.ReadWrite`
     - `Team.ReadBasic.All`
     - `TeamSettings.ReadWrite.All`
     - `Channel.ReadBasic.All`
     - `ChannelSettings.ReadWrite.All`
     - `offline_access`

#### 🔑 Authenticate/Sign Out Button

The component provides a versatile button designed to toggle between **Authenticate** and **Sign Out** based on the current authentication state within the OAuth setup.

- **Authenticate Button**: This button serves as an additional method to authenticate, complementing the main **Authenticate** button already present in the component.
- **Sign Out Button**: Allows users to sign out when they are currently authenticated.

This button serves a critical role in scenarios where the component cannot retrieve a valid token due to reasons such as:
- The token is invalid.
- The token has expired.
- Other token-related issues.

In such cases, you can use the combo action of signing out and authenticating again to resolve these token-related problems, ensuring seamless authentication management within your application.
