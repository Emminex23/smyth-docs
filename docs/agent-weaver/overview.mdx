## Best Practices

**Design**
- • Start with basic functionality and gradually add complexity as needed
- • Test each component and connection thoroughly during development
- • Document changes and configuration decisions for future reference
- • Verify all component connections and data flow patterns
**Communication**
- • Be specific about requirements and expected behaviors when describing needs
- • Provide concrete examples of desired inputs, outputs, and processing logic
- • Use consistent terminology when referring to components and functions
- • Test thoroughly across different scenarios and edge cases
**Testing and Validation**
- • Always test your agent manually - AI assistance has limitations
- • Verify critical functionality independently of Weaver's suggestions
- • Test edge cases and error handling explicitly
- • For API-dependent workflows, use the [Mock Data](components/APICall?id=mock-data) feature to test without actual API keys.
- • Monitor agent performance in production environments

> **Note**: While Weaver provides intelligent assistance, manual testing and verification are essential for production deployments.
