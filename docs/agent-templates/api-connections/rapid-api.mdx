# Connect RapidAPI to Your Agent

[RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) gives you access to thousands of public APIs you can use inside your agents. One popular example is the **Website Contacts Scraper**.

This guide walks you through setting up your RapidAPI account, retrieving your API key, and subscribing to the contact scraping endpoint.

> Need help using this API inside an agent? See [Lead Contact Scraper Agent](/docs/agent-templates/lead-contact-scraper) for a full working example.
