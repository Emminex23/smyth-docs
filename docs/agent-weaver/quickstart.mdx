# Quickstart: Get Started with Weaver

> **Need an agent in five minutes?** 
> **Weaver** is the **no-code AI workflow builder** inside SmythOS.  
> Describe a goal in plain language → Weaver assembles, connects, and generates the agent for you.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** In the next three minutes you’ll create, debug, and deploy a working agent without touching YAML, APIs, or the visual canvas.

## Prerequisites

- A SmythOS account (<DocLink to="https://app.smythos.com/signup">sign up</DocLink> if you’re new).  
- Zero coding skills. Weaver handles the heavy lifting.
- Think of a goal... e.g. *“Send daily summaries from Airtable to Slack.”*

That’s it. **No config files. No coding.**

## Step 1 - Describe What You Want

Open Weaver and paste the prompt below:

<PromptCard prompt={`Create an agent that writes SEO-optimized blog posts and publishes them to WordPress.\n\nThe agent should have the following skills:\n- Write article from a topic\n- Extract research keywords\n- Post article to WordPress using a given URL`} />

Weaver will instantly:

- Parse the prompt  
- Select and connect relevant components
- Build the first draft visually and

## Step 2 - Let Weaver Think and Propose

After you describe your goal, Weaver enters a "Thinking..." phase where it:

- Interprets your intent
- Suggests a workflow plan based on your request
- Asks follow-up questions to clarify details like:

    - What kind of blogs are you targeting?
    - Do you want keyword extraction to be optional or required?
    - Which CMS platform are you using—WordPress.com or self-hosted?

Then it drafts a complete workflow such as:

- Generate blog structure
- Write full content
- Research topics
- Publish (optional)

## Step 3 - Review the Draft

You’ll see a canvas with three cards:

- **GenAI Writer**  
- **Keyword Extractor**  
- **WordPress Poster**

Hover to inspect inputs/outputs, click to edit, or drag to adjust wiring.

> **Circles legend** — ● = required input, ○ = optional

## Step 4 - Test It Live

Ask the agent:

<PromptCard prompt={`Write a post about “Top AI trends in 2025.”`} />

Watch real-time outputs:

- Article text  
- Extracted keywords  
- WordPress publish confirmation  

Weaver’s **LLM orchestration framework** gives inline feedback—no silent errors.

## Step 5 - Debug in Place (Enable Debug Mode)

If a step fails:

1. Click the red-bordered component.  
2. Review the snapshot of I/O and Weaver’s explanation.  
3. Hit **Fix with AI**... often one click is enough.  
4. Multi-select with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + click to repair several blocks together.

## Step 6 - Deploy Your Agent

When everything passes:

1. Choose <DocLink to='../agent-deployments/overview'> **Deploy**</DocLink> and go with the default Agent Cloud option which hosts the agent on our infrastructure or download the SRE for running locally. 
2. Tag your version in case you want to restore a previously deployed instance.

Weaver allows you:

- Share the agent to <DocLink to='../agent-collaborations/overview>'> collaborate</DocLink> with your friends and colleagues by inviting them
- To debug using activity logs

<InfoCallout>
**You did it!** You used prompt-based agent creation to build, test, and deploy without ever opening the drag-and-drop canvas. That’s true **no-code agent orchestration**.
