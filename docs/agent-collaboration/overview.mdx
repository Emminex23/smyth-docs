# Agent Collaboration

Great agents don’t happen in isolation. SmythOS makes it simple for teams to **build, share, and run agents together** while keeping credentials safe and projects organized.

<InfoCallout title="In one line">
Create a [Space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/), invite your team, store keys in the [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault), and collaborate with agents in real time.
</InfoCallout>

## Why Collaboration Matters

Agents become more powerful when they’re connected to shared data, tested by multiple people, and managed with clear roles.  
SmythOS gives you the structure to do that without losing control:

- Keep client or project work separated into **[Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/)**  
- Control access with **[Roles and Permissions](/docs/account-management/user-management)**  
- Secure API keys in the **[Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)**  
- Share knowledge through the **[Data Pool](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/data-spaces)**  
- Work directly with agents using **[Chat with Agent](/docs/agent-collaboration/chat-with-agent)**  
- Monitor usage and costs with **[Analytics](/docs/account-management/user-management)**  
- Export, share, or [move agents across projects](/docs/agent-collaboration/sharing-agents)  
- Apply your own [branding with White Labeling](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/white-labeling)  

This creates a single place where your whole team can work confidently, whether you’re a startup, an agency, or an enterprise.

## Core Building Blocks

| Building Block | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| **[Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/)** | Project-based workspaces for agents, data, and teammates | Keep projects separate but easy to manage |
| **[Roles & Permissions](/docs/account-management/user-management)** | Assign Viewer, Editor, Admin, or Super Admin | Stay secure while enabling collaboration |
| **[Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)** | Encrypted key and secret storage | Share API credentials safely across agents |
| **[Data Pool](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/data-spaces)** | Shared datasets and knowledge sources | Give agents collective memory |
| **[Chat with Agent](/docs/agent-collaboration/chat-with-agent)** | Real-time collaboration and testing | Explore, debug, and iterate together |
| **[Analytics](/docs/account-management/user-management)** | Track token usage and costs | Stay in control of performance and spend |
| **[Sharing & Exporting](/docs/agent-collaboration/sharing-agents)** | Move workflows between projects | Flexible handoff and portability |
| **[White Labeling](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/white-labeling)** | Apply custom branding to spaces | Perfect for client-facing work |

## How to Get Started

1. **[Create a Space](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/)** → Organize your first project or client.  
2. **[Invite Teammates](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces/invite-members)** → Add members and assign roles.  
3. **[Assign Roles](/docs/account-management/user-management)** → Decide who can view, edit, or deploy.  
4. **[Secure Credentials in the Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)** → Store API keys safely for shared use.  
5. **[Add Data to the Pool](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/data-spaces)** → Give agents a shared knowledge base.  
6. **[Collaborate with Agents](/docs/agent-collaboration/chat-with-agent)** → Test and debug in real time.  
7. **[Track Analytics](/docs/account-management/user-management)** → Monitor usage, performance, and costs.
