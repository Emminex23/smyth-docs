# Introduction

Welcome to Agent Studio — your home base for building, running, and scaling AI agents with SmythOS—the horizontal orchestration layer that fuses LLMs, reasoners, and enterprise-grade guardrails into one secure, human-supervised workflow engine.

These docs walk you through everything from a five-minute Quickstart to deep dives on advanced topics like Retrieval-Augmented Generation, multi-LLM routing, observability, and self-hosted runtime deployment.

> Our documentation is a work in progress. We ship fast and document just as quickly—pull requests, issues, and typo fixes are always welcome. Let’s make agent development easier for everyone.
