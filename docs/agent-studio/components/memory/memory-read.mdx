# Memory Read Component

Use the Memory Read component to retrieve a value previously stored in memory by key.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
Reading memory allows you to re-use stored state in later parts of your workflow. For example, retrieving a `user-id` written earlier and passing it to an API call.

## Step 1: Configure Memory Name

Provide the **Memory Name** used when the values were stored. Without the correct memory name, no data can be retrieved.

| Setting         | Required? | Description                                          | Example             |
|-----------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| **Memory Name** | <Badge type="required">Yes</Badge> | The namespace under which values are grouped. | `session-memory`    |

## Step 2: Provide Key 

<TipCallout title="Exact match required"> Memory name and key must exactly match the values used when writing. </TipCallout> 

Set the Key to fetch exactly one value.

Example:
```json 
{ "memory_name": "session_memory", "key": "user_id" }
```

<InfoCallout title="Check the Scope">
If you cannot find values you expect, check if they were stored in **Request** scope instead of **Persistent**.  
</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices

- Always confirm the memory name matches the one used in the write operation.  
- Use bulk reads carefully if the memory contains large objects.  
- Combine reads with debugging to verify retrieved values.

## Troubleshooting Tips

<InfoCallout title="If your memory read isn’t working...">
- **Empty result?** Double-check memory name and key.  
- **Values missing?** They may have been written in Request scope and expired after execution.  
- **Unexpected data?** Ensure no other workflow wrote to the same memory name with overlapping keys.

## FAQs

  **Does Memory Read return all keys if no key is provided**  
  No. Memory Read retrieves exactly one key. If `key` resolves to empty at runtime, the component will not execute and you will see a validation or skipped step outcome.

  **How do I reliably read a value written with TTL**  
  Use the same `memory_name` and `key` before the TTL expires.

  **Why am I getting an empty result**  
  - Wrong `memory_name` or `key`  
  - Value was written with `Request` scope and the run ended  
  - TTL expired  
  - Reading in a different environment than the write

  **Can I provide the key dynamically**  
  Yes. Map it from a prior step or input. Guard against empty values.

  **How do I fetch several values**  
  Call Memory Read for each key or iterate over a known list of keys. There is no built in read all action.

## What to Try Next

- Store values using the **[Memory Write Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/memory/memory-write)**.  
- Write multiple keys at once with the **[Memory Write Multi Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/memory/memory-write-multi)**.  
- Remove unneeded data using the **[Memory Delete Component](/docs/agent-studio/components/memory/memory-delete)**.
