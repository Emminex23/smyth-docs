# Introduction to Studio

<InfoCallout title="What is Agent Studio?">
**Agent Studio** is a cloud-based visual builder for creating and managing agents in SmythOS. Use modular [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components) to define workflows that control how agents reason and act. Connect LLMs, enterprise data, and third-party tools into secure, human-guided automations.
This guide covers everything from a 2-minute quickstart to advanced topics like [RAG](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-search), multi-LLM routing, and [production deployment](/docs/agent-deployments/overview).
</InfoCallout>

## Start Here: What You Can Do With Studio

Studio is built for users who want to:

- Prototype AI workflows visually  
- Deploy with LLMs, APIs, and use options like MCP  
- Handle structured and unstructured inputs  
- Automate tasks across teams and systems  
- Deploy secure, production-grade agents

# What Studio Offers

Agent Studio is a visual canvas designed to simplify the creation of complex AI agents. It provides a suite of tools that let you:

* **Visualize Workflows:** Instantly test, inspect, and refine your agent's logic as you build.
* **Integrate Seamlessly:** Connect your agent to any process on the internet, from internal tools using [webhooks](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-webhook) to thousands of third-party APIs.
* **Handle Multiple Inputs:** Define custom inputs and outputs to process text, images, files, and structured data.
* **Build with AI:** Leverage advanced components for classification, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making.
* **Customize Everything:** Modify every aspect of your agent, from its core logic to its final [deployment](/docs/agent-deployments/overview), with unparalleled control.

## Learn How Studio is Structured

Understanding the platform's layout will help you navigate and build more efficiently.

| Concept             | Description                                                                                             |

| **Builder Canvas** | The visual drag-and-drop environment where you design and connect the components of your agent's workflow. |
| **Agents Page** | The central hub where you can manage, deploy, and organize all your agents into different [Project Spaces](/docs/account-management/spaces-management). |
| **[Agent Settings](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/overview)** | A dedicated area to control an agent's behavior, security, and deployment configurations.      |
| **[The Vault](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/vault)** | A secure, centralized location to manage and use your API keys and other secrets across all your agents. |
| **[Analytics](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/analytics)** | A dashboard to monitor your token usage and control your costs.                                 |
| **[Data Pool](/docs/agent-collaboration/working-with-agents/data-spaces)** | A centralized RAG management system for your agent's knowledge base. |
