  <summary>Why Integrate Replicate with Your Agent?</summary>

Replicate makes it incredibly simple to run a vast array of open-source machine learning models via a clean API. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to incorporate highly specialized AI capabilities into your workflows.

- **Access a Massive Model Library:** Go beyond standard text and image generation. Use models for video creation, music generation, image restoration, speech-to-text, and countless other specialized tasks.
- **Simplified AI Infrastructure:** Run complex models on powerful hardware without managing servers or worrying about dependencies. Replicate handles all the infrastructure for you.
- **Automate Creative Pipelines:** Chain Replicate models with other components. For example, use an AI text model to write a script, an Elevenlabs model to create a voiceover, and a Replicate model to generate a video.
- **Prototype and Scale:** Quickly experiment with different models to find the best one for your task. Replicate's pay-as-you-go pricing makes it easy to scale your usage as your needs grow.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following:

- An active **SmythOS account**. ([Sign up here](https://app.smythos.com/signup)).
- A **Replicate account**.
- Your Replicate **API Token**.

## Getting Started With Replicate

The connection between SmythOS and Replicate is configured using a secure API Token.

### Step 1: Get Your Replicate API Token
1.  Log in to your [Replicate account](https://replicate.com/).
2.  Navigate to your [Account settings](https://replicate.com/account) and click on the **API Tokens** tab.
3.  Your API token is displayed on this page. Copy it to your clipboard.

### Step 2: Store Your API Token in SmythOS Vault
Your API Token is a sensitive credential. Use the SmythOS `Vault` to store it securely.

1.  In your SmythOS dashboard, navigate to the **Vault**.
2.  Create a new secret and paste your Replicate API Token as the value. Give it a memorable name, like `replicate_api_token`.
3.  For more details, see the [Vault Documentation](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement).

### Step 3: Configure the Replicate Component
1.  In your SmythOS agent graph, drag and drop the **Replicate Run Model** component.
2.  Click the component to open its **Settings** panel.
3.  In the `API Token` field, select the secret you saved in the Vault (e.g., `replicate_api_token`).
4.  Your connection is now configured for that component.

<InfoCallout title="Heads-up">You must add the API Token from the Vault to each Replicate component you use. This ensures all your API calls are properly authenticated.</InfoCallout>

## Which Replicate Model Should I Use?
The power of this integration comes from the thousands of models available on Replicate. To find a model, browse the [Replicate Explore page](https://replicate.com/explore).

| If you need toâ€¦ | Task Category | Example Model |
|-----------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Generate a photorealistic image** | Text-to-Image | `stability-ai/sdxl` |
| **Create a video from text** | Text-to-Video | `anotherjesse/zeroscope-v2-xl` |
| **Transcribe an audio file** | Speech-to-Text | `openai/whisper` |
| **Upscale a low-resolution image** | Image-to-Image | `nightmareai/real-esrgan` |
| **Generate music from a prompt** | Text-to-Audio | `meta/musicgen` |

<TipCallout>
When you find a model you want to use on the Replicate website, click on its "API" tab to see the exact **model version** string and the required **input** format.

## Component Details

This section provides detailed information for the universal Replicate component.

### <a name="run-model"></a>Run Model
Runs inference on any public model available on the Replicate platform.

<InfoCallout>This component requires an `API Token` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-replicate) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Inputs
| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `version` | string | Yes | The specific version ID of the model you want to run. Find this on the "API" tab of the model's page on Replicate. |
| `input` | object | Yes | A JSON object containing the inputs for the model. The structure of this object is specific to each model. |

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `output` | any | The direct output from the model. This could be a string (text), a URL (to an image/video), or a more complex JSON object. |
| `Response`| object | The full, raw JSON response from the Replicate API, containing metadata about the prediction. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |

<TipCallout title="Use Case: Image Generation" collapsible>
An agent takes a text prompt, "a majestic lion in a golden crown, digital painting," and passes it to the `stability-ai/sdxl` model. The `output` will be a URL pointing to the generated image.
</TipCallout>

```json
{
  "component": "replicate.runModel",
  "version": "db21e45d3f7023abc2a46ee38a23973f6dce16bb082a930b0c49861f96d1e5bf",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "a majestic lion in a golden crown, digital painting"
  }
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Check Model Inputs!">
The most critical step is to check the model's "API" tab on the Replicate website to see the exact names and data types required for the `input` object. An incorrect input structure is the most common cause of errors.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Token:** Always use the SmythOS `Vault` to store your Replicate API token.
* **Copy the Full Model Version:** Don't just use the model name (e.g., `stability-ai/sdxl`). You must use the full version hash provided on the model's API page to ensure your agent's stability.
* **Handle Asynchronous Behavior:** Some complex models on Replicate run asynchronously. The component in SmythOS handles this by waiting for the result. Be aware that long-running models may cause your agent to wait for a minute or more.
* **Parse the `output`:** The structure of the `output` field varies completely between models. It might be a simple URL string, or it could be an array of objects. You will often need to use a "Code" component to parse this output for downstream steps.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Token is missing, invalid, or disabled.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Token in your SmythOS Vault is correct and matches the one in your Replicate account settings.

* **Error: `402 Payment Required`**
  * **Cause:** You have run out of funds in your Replicate account, or the model you are trying to run is not free.
  * **Solution:** Check your billing status and add credits to your Replicate account.

* **Error: `404 Not Found` (for a model)**
  * **Cause:** The `version` ID is incorrect or misspelled.
  * **Solution:** Go to the model's page on Replicate and copy the full, correct version string from the "API" tab.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` / Input Validation Error**
  * **Cause:** The `input` object is missing a required field or contains a field with the wrong data type.
  * **Solution:** Meticulously check the "API" tab on the model's page on Replicate. Compare your `input` object structure with their example to ensure every parameter is correct.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build agents with a virtually limitless set of AI capabilities using the **SmythOS Replicate Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Takes a user's selfie, sends it to an image restoration model on Replicate to improve the quality, and then sends it to an image-to-video model to create a short animation.
    * Transcribes a podcast episode using Whisper on Replicate, then feeds the transcript to an LLM on [OpenRouter](/docs/integrations/openrouter) to generate show notes and timestamps.
    * Generates background music for a video using a text-to-audio model on Replicate based on a mood description.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Replicate with the [Elevenlabs Integration](/docs/integrations/elevenlabs) to create full video content: use Replicate for video generation and Elevenlabs for the voiceover.
    * Generate images with Replicate and store them in [OneDrive](/docs/integrations/onedrive) or another cloud storage service.
    * Use Replicate's speech-to-text models to process audio from customer support calls, then log the transcript and a summary to your CRM.
