## AI & LLM components

These components provide direct access to AI models and advanced language processing:

- `GenAILLM` — Integrate with multiple LLM providers through a unified interface  
- `VisionLLM` — Analyze and interpret images using AI  
- `MultimodalLLM` — Process text, images, and audio inputs together  
- `LLMAssistant` — Build conversational AI assistants with context awareness  
- `HuggingFace` — Access Hugging Face model hubs and APIs  
- `ImageGenerator` — Generate images based on textual prompts  

## External integrations

Components that connect your agents to external data sources and services:

- `APICall` — Make HTTP API requests, supporting OAuth authentication  
- `WebSearch` — Perform web searches to retrieve up-to-date information  
- `WebScrape` — Extract content from websites for analysis  
- `ZapierAction` — Trigger workflows and automations via Zapier  
- `MCPClient` — Communicate using the Model Context Protocol  

## Data processing components

Help your agent organize, clean, and interpret data:

- `DataSourceIndexer` — Index large document collections for fast lookup  
- `DataSourceLookup` — Search and retrieve relevant data from sources  
- `DataSourceCleaner` — Normalize and clean data inputs  
- `JSONFilter` — Manipulate JSON-formatted data structures  
- `Classifier` — Categorize content into defined classes  

## Logic & control flow

Control the decision-making and flow of your agent’s tasks:

- `LogicAND`, `LogicOR`, `LogicXOR` — Perform boolean logic operations  
- `LogicAtLeast`, `LogicAtMost` — Conditional logic based on thresholds  
- `ForEach` — Iterate over lists and execute workflows repeatedly  
- `Async`, `Await` — Manage asynchronous operations within workflows  

## Storage & file operations

Components focused on managing files and code execution:

- `FileStore` — Read, write, and manage files within your agent environment  
- `Code` — Execute custom code snippets dynamically  
- `ServerlessCode` — Run serverless functions for scalable logic  

## System integration

Connect your agent to system-level features and plugins:

- `ComputerUse` — Automate system and computer interactions
