# Quickstart: How to Create Your First Agent with Weaver

> **Need an agent in five minutes?**  
> **Agent Weaver** is the **no-code AI workflow builder** inside SmythOS.  
> Describe a goal in plain language → Weaver assembles, wires, and tests the agent for you.

<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** In the next three minutes you’ll create, debug, and deploy a working agent without touching YAML, APIs, or the visual canvas.

## Step 0 - One-Minute Setup

- A SmythOS account (<DocLink to="https://app.smythos.com/signup">sign up</DocLink> if you’re new).  
- Zero coding skills — Weaver handles the heavy lifting.
- Think of a goal — e.g. *“Send daily summaries from Airtable to Slack.”*

That’s it. **No config files, no JSON, just intention.**

<Divider/>

## Step 1 - Describe What You Want

Open Weaver and paste the prompt below:

<PromptCard prompt={`Create an agent that writes SEO-optimized blog posts and publishes them to WordPress.\n\nThe agent should have the following skills:\n- Write article from a topic\n- Extract research keywords\n- Post article to WordPress using a given URL`} />

Weaver will instantly:

- Parse the prompt  
- Suggest matching components  
- Build the first draft visually

## Step 2 - Review the Draft

You’ll see a canvas with three cards:

- **GenAI Writer**  
- **Keyword Extractor**  
- **WordPress Poster**

Hover to inspect inputs/outputs, click to edit, or drag to adjust wiring.

> **Circles legend** — ● = required input, ○ = optional

## Step 3 - Run It Live

Ask the agent:

<PromptCard prompt={`Write a post about “Top AI trends in 2025.”`} />

Watch real-time outputs:

- Article text  
- Extracted keywords  
- WordPress publish confirmation  

Weaver’s **LLM orchestration framework** gives inline feedback—no silent errors.

## Step 4 - Debug in Place

If a step fails:

1. Click the red-bordered component.  
2. Review the snapshot of I/O and Weaver’s explanation.  
3. Hit **Fix with AI** — often one click is enough.  
4. Multi-select with <kbd>Cmd/Ctrl</kbd> + click to repair several blocks together.

## Step 5 - Save & Launch

When everything passes:

1. Click **Save Agent**.  
2. Choose **Deploy as Chat Widget** *or* **API Endpoint**.  
3. Tag your version.

Weaver returns:

- Shareable URLs to <DocLink to='../agent-collaborations/overview>'> collaborate</DocLink> with your friends and colleagues
- Embed code for apps/sites  
- Activity logs for future debugging  

<InfoCallout>
**You did it!** You used prompt-based agent creation to build, test, and deploy without ever opening the drag-and-drop canvas. That’s true **no-code agent orchestration**.
