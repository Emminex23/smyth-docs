# 🌟 Computer Use

The **Computer Use** component is an AI-powered virtual computer that executes tasks based on natural language instructions. It enables your agent to perform complex computer operations autonomously, providing results in a structured format.

> **Note:** This component is exclusively available for Enterprise accounts. [Contact us](https://smythos.com/contact-us/) to get access.

## Overview

The Computer Use component functions as a virtual computer operated by AI. It can perform a wide range of tasks that you would typically execute on a physical computer, from data analysis to web searches, all driven by natural language prompts. This reduces the need for custom code and enables non-technical users to automate complex operations.

---

## Settings

Enter natural language instructions for the AI computer to execute. The component interprets these instructions and performs the requested tasks, leveraging advanced AI models to understand context and intent.

For example:
- "Search for the current weather in New York and extract the temperature and conditions"
- "Find the latest stock price for Microsoft and calculate the 7-day average"
- "Look up population data for the top 10 cities in California and create a summary table"

## Inputs

The Computer Use component comes with a default input:

- **Prompt**: The primary instruction that guides the AI computer's operations. Connect this to outputs from other components to dynamically generate tasks.

To add additional inputs, click the "+" icon next to the **Inputs** label and enter required details:

- **Name:** Unique, self-explanatory identifier (e.g., `location`, `query`)
- **Type:** Supports `Any`, `String`, `Number`, `Integer`, `Boolean`, `Array`, `Object`, `Binary`, `Date`
- **Color (optional):** Enhances visual clarity in workflows
- **Optional (optional):** Mark non-mandatory inputs
- **Default Value (optional):** Predefined value used when no explicit value is supplied

---

## Outputs

The Computer Use component has a single built-in output named **`Output`**, containing the complete results of the executed tasks.

To add additional custom outputs:
- Click the "+" icon next to the **Outputs** label
- Name your new output based on the specific data you want to extract (e.g., `weather`, `stockPrice`, `summary`)
- SmythOS automatically recognizes that the source data comes from the default Output

This capability allows you to route different result elements to various components in your workflow without complex data manipulation.

## Use Cases

- **Data Retrieval and Analysis**: Extract and process information from multiple sources
- **Research Automation**: Conduct web research and compile findings
- **Content Generation**: Create structured content based on gathered information
- **Report Creation**: Automatically generate reports from data sources
- **System Automation**: Execute complex multi-step computer operations

---

### How It Works

1. The component receives a natural language prompt describing the desired task
2. The AI interprets the instructions and formulates an execution plan
3. The virtual computer executes the necessary operations to fulfill the request
4. Results are processed and structured into the output
5. Additional outputs can extract specific elements from the results

> **⚠️ Limitations**
>
> - Tasks are limited to operations that can be performed in a secure, isolated environment
> - The component cannot access private systems or networks without proper authentication
> - Complex or ambiguous instructions may require refinement for optimal results
> - Processing time varies based on task complexity

### Best Practices

- **Be Specific**: Provide clear, detailed instructions for best results
- **Start Simple**: Begin with straightforward tasks and gradually increase complexity
- **Test Iteratively**: Refine prompts based on output results
- **Create Dedicated Outputs**: Set up specific outputs for each data element you need to extract
- **Connect Strategically**: Feed results into appropriate downstream components for further processing
