# Agent Bulk Work

Use the **Agent Bulk Work** interface to run an agent’s endpoint on multiple sets of inputs in one go. Whether you're generating summaries, classifying data, or batch-processing tasks—Bulk Work helps you scale it with ease.

<InfoCallout>
Bulk Work is ideal for processing structured inputs—like lead lists, prompt variations, or product records—without writing code or calling APIs.

## Overview

Bulk Work allows you to run any deployed agent’s endpoint across many inputs simultaneously. You can either enter rows manually or upload a properly formatted CSV file.

## Step 1: Open Bulk Work for an Endpoint

1. Go to the **Agents** page and open your deployed agent.
2. Under the **Endpoints** section, choose the endpoint you want to run.
3. Click `Bulk Work`.

You’ll land on a table view where you can input data rows or upload a CSV.

## Step 2: Add Input Data

### Option A: Add Rows Manually

- Click `Add Row`
- Enter values for the required input fields
- Add multiple rows as needed

This is useful for quick tests or lightweight runs.

### Option B: Upload a CSV File

- Click `Upload CSV`
- The file must include exact input names in the header row

<WarningCallout>
The **first row** of your CSV must exactly match the names of the endpoint’s input fields. Any mismatch will result in a processing error.

### Example CSV Format

| query                          | max_results |
|-------------------------------|-------------|
| digital marketing trends 2023 | 5           |
| AI developments healthcare     | 10          |
| sustainable energy innovations | 7           |

Rows will automatically populate into the interface upon upload.

## Step 3: Run the Tasks

- Click `Run` on any row to execute it individually
- Click `Run in Bulk` to execute all rows at once

The agent will process each row through the selected endpoint and return results inline.

## Step 4: Review the Results

Once complete:

- Each row will display output fields filled with the agent’s response
- You can scroll and scan directly in the table
- Use **Logs Explorer** for deeper output inspection or system-level review
