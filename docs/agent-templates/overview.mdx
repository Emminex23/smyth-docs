# Templates

Templates are the fastest way to turn an idea into a working agent. With [SmythOS Templates](https://app.smythos.com/templates), you start from a ready-made blueprint for real-world tasks like scraping LinkedIn leads, analyzing sentiment, or managing Dropbox folders. You can open a template, remix it, and deploy in just a few clicks. 

<InfoCallout title="What is a Template?">
A **Template** is a prebuilt agent setup for a specific job. It comes with tested components, default settings, and a working flow so you can get started immediately and then customize as you go.

## How to Use a Template

Here’s how to go from browsing a template to deploying your own agent:

### Step 1: Open Templates
Go to the **Templates** tab in **Studio** or open the gallery at [app.smythos.com/templates](https://app.smythos.com/templates).

### Step 2: Pick the right template
Browse by category or use search. Open a template to see its description, required credentials, and a preview of the workflow.

### Step 3: Remix
Click **Remix** to create your own copy inside Studio. This gives you a fully editable version.

### Step 4: Connect credentials
Go to **Studio → Settings → Credentials** to add any required API keys or accounts.  
Most templates need at least one provider key. Always store secrets in the Vault, not inside node fields.

### Step 5: Test your agent
Choose a test mode that matches how you plan to run the agent:

| Mode        | What it does                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Form**    | Enter structured inputs and review outputs    |
| **Chat**    | Talk to the agent in a chat-style interface   |
| **API**     | Send a request like the production endpoint   |
| **LLM**     | Try out an LLM integration                    |
| **Postman** | Run real API calls with Postman               |
| **Alexa**   | Test voice requests                           |
| **MCP**     | Use Model Context Protocol                    |
| **GPT**     | Validate with GPT-based clients               |

### Step 6: Deploy
When the template behaves as expected:  
1. Click **Deploy** in Studio  
2. Select **Agent Cloud** as the hosting option  
3. Assign a version number  
4. Share the live HTTPS URL  

<WarningCallout title="Troubleshooting tip">
If testing fails, check your credentials, required inputs, and any provider rate limits. Most errors resolve after adding the missing key, correcting inputs, or raising limits.

## Finding the Right Template

Here are a few ways to narrow your search:

- Look up the platform you use (for example: Slack, Airtable, Dropbox)  
- Filter by what you want to achieve (summarize, classify, extract)  
- Open the template to review required credentials and example inputs  
- Start with the closest match and **Remix** to adjust it for your needs  

<Spacer size="md" />

## Template Anatomy

Each template usually includes:

- **Inputs**: values you provide when running it, like a URL or file  
- **Components**: nodes such as connectors, tools, or LLM steps  
- **Flow**: how data moves between steps  
- **Outputs**: the result, such as text, JSON, or a file  

Knowing these parts makes customizing easier.

## Security and Credentials

- Add API keys in **Studio → Settings → Credentials**  
- Give only the permissions required for the template  
- Rotate or revoke secrets when access changes  
- Never paste secrets directly into node fields  

<Spacer size="md" />

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing credentials**: add the required key and retest  
- **Invalid inputs**: check field requirements and examples  
- **Rate limits**: reduce batch size, add retries, or request higher limits  
- **Workflow errors**: inspect the failing block, review the snapshot, and use **Fix with AI**
