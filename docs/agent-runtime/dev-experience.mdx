# Developer experience with SRE

> Building AI agents should be smooth and productive. SRE offers you flexible options that fit your workflow and skillset.

<InfoCallout>
**What to expect:**  
You can design agents visually, code them programmatically, monitor execution in real time, and extend capabilities with custom components.
</InfoCallout>

## Dual creation modes

SRE supports two complementary ways to build agents:

1. **Visual designer**  
   - Drag and drop components  
   - Connect inputs and outputs visually  
   - Ideal for rapid prototyping and collaboration with non-technical stakeholders  

2. **SDK programming**  
   - Use a type-safe SDK with full IntelliSense  
   - Write custom logic and workflows in code  
   - Integrate with CI/CD and version control  

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "sourceId": "llm_1",
      "targetId": "classifier_1",
      "sourceIndex": 0,
      "targetIndex": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

```JavaScript
// Example: SDK creating and connecting components programmatically
const llm = SDK.GenAILLM({ model: 'gpt-4' }, agent);
const classifier = SDK.Classifier({ classes: ['positive', 'negative'] }, agent);

classifier.in({ Input: llm.out.Reply });
```

## Real-time monitoring and debugging

Stay in control with:

- Live Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming for execution updates  
- Detailed logs and execution traces per component  
- Performance and resource usage dashboards  
- Debug mode for stepwise execution analysis  

## Custom components and skills

Extend SRE beyond defaults by:

- Writing your own components inheriting the base class  
- Adding custom skills your agents can call as tools  

```typescript
// Example: custom component class
export class MyCustomComponent extends Component {
  async process(input, config, agent) {
    // Your logic here
    return { result: processedData };
  }
}
```

```typescript
// Example: adding a custom skill to an agent
const weatherSkill = agent.addSkill({
  name: 'getWeather',
  description: 'Get current weather for a location',
  ai_exposed: true,
  process: async (location) => {
    // Fetch weather info from API
    return { temperature: 72, condition: 'sunny' };
  },
});
```
