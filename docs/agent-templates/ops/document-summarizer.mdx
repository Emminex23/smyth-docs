# Document Summarizer Agent  

The **Document Summarizer Agent** makes it easy to process long PDFs into clear, structured summaries. You upload a PDF, and the agent will:  

- Extract the full text  
- Analyze the content with AI  
- Generate a **well-organized summary** with key points, details, and insights  

Perfect for research papers, contracts, reports, manuals, and any PDF where you need quick comprehension.  

<InfoCallout title="Why use this agent?">  
Instead of reading entire documents, you get a **fast and accurate summary** that highlights what really matters.

## Customization Tips  
<TipCallout title="Example customization">  
Need **legal-ready summaries**? Add a Code block to extract **parties, dates, payment terms, and obligations** directly from contracts.  
</TipCallout>  
- **Error handling** – Add outputs to capture failed PDFs or inaccessible files  
- **Content processing** – Use a **GenAILLM** block to summarize, clean, or structure text further  
- **Multiple PDFs** – Modify inputs to accept arrays for batch processing  
- **Authentication** – Add headers to access secured PDFs  
- **Content filtering** – Use a **Classifier** to sort summaries by topic (e.g., legal, technical, financial)  
- **Rate limiting** – Add **FSleep** when summarizing multiple documents
