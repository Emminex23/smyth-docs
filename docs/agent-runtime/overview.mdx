# Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)

The Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE) is a production-ready runtime platform purpose-built for AI agents. SRE abstracts away infrastructure complexity so you can focus on designing intelligent agent logic.

<InfoCallout title="Core Philosophy">
SRE follows operating system design principles. Through separation of core runtime services from pluggable connectors, SRE offers modularity, security, and flexibility across all agent workloads.
</InfoCallout>

## Ways to Build: Studio, SDK, and CLI

SRE supports multiple ways to build and manage agents, so you can pick what fits your workflow.

- [**Studio**](/docs/agent-studio/overview) (Visual builder): Drag-and-drop interface for agent flows. Great for rapid prototyping and cross-functional teams.
- [**SDK**](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) (Code-first): Write, connect, and extend agents in TypeScript for full control and CI/CD support.
- [**CLI**](/docs/agent-runtime/cli-guide) (Command line): Scaffold, run, and manage agents or workflows directly from your terminal.

## Subsystem Architecture

SRE is organized into modular subsystems, each responsible for a core area of the agent runtime:

| Subsystem | Purpose | Key Features |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------ |
| [**IO**](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#io-subsystem) | Data input/output, storage, API routing, logging | Pluggable connectors for Storage, VectorDB, etc. |
| [**LLM Manager**](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#llm-manager-subsystem) | Unified access to LLMs, inference, caching, usage tracking | Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Anthropic, more) |
| [**Security**](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#security-subsystem) | Credentials, authentication, secrets, access policies | Vault-backed storage, ACLs, identity management |
| [**Memory Manager**](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#memory-manager-subsystem) | Tracks agent state, multi-tier caching, session/conversation context | RAM/Redis/S3/Local cache, context management |
| [**Agent Manager**](/docs/agent-runtime/architecture#agent-manager-subsystem) | Orchestrates agent execution, lifecycle, monitoring, component workflows | Real-time logs, async ops, visual workflow support |

## Security-First Design

<TipCallout title="Advanced patterns from the SRE repo">
For advanced patterns, sample projects, and the latest updates, see the official [SRE GitHub repository](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre).
</TipCallout>

SRE enforces security at every level using a zero-trust **Candidate/ACL** model. Every resource access, like storage or APIs, is scoped to a specific candidate identity and explicitly permissioned.

```typescript
const candidate = AccessCandidate.agent(agentId);
const storage = ConnectorService.getStorageConnector().user(candidate);
await storage.write('data.json', content);
```

All agent actions are isolated by default.

## Building Agents: Studio, SDK, and CLI

You can build and manage agents in several ways.

<InfoCallout title="Explore all agent-building options">
See [Building Agents](/docs/agent-runtime/building-agents) for a full guide, or [Hybrid Workflows](/docs/agent-runtime/hybrid-workflows) to combine Studio and SDK.
</InfoCallout>

### SDK (Code-First)

The [Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) provides a developer-friendly API for defining, configuring, and extending agents programmatically.

#### Agent Definition and Skills

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@smythos/sdk';

const agent = new Agent({
    name: 'DataAnalyst',
    model: 'gpt-4',
    behavior: 'You are an expert data analyst.',
});

agent.addSkill({
    name: 'processData',
    description: 'Analyze and process data',
    process: async (data) => {
        return { analysis: 'processed' };
    },
});
```

#### Composing Workflows with Components

```typescript
import { Component } from '@smythos/sdk';

const llm = Component.GenAILLM({ model: 'gpt-4' }, agent);
const classifier = Component.Classifier({ classes: ['positive', 'negative'] }, agent);

classifier.in({ Input: llm.out.Reply });
```

### CLI (Command-Line)

You can also use the SmythOS CLI to quickly scaffold new projects, manage agent workflows, and deploy agents.

- Scaffold new projects interactively
- Run agents and workflows from the command line
- Integrate CLI flows with SDK or Studio as needed

#### Project Management with SRE CLI

- **Scaffold:**  
  ```bash 
  npm i -g @smythos/cli 
  ```
  ```bash 
  sre create
  ```

- **Run an agent:**  
  ```bash 
  sre run ./my-agent.smyth 
  ```  
  or  
  ```bash 
  sre run 
  ```

The CLI is ideal for rapid prototyping, local testing, or integrating with other tools in your stack.

### Studio (Visual Builder)

- Design agent logic visually in your browser with drag-and-drop flows
- Instantly preview, test, and debug in real time
- Great for non-coders, cross-functional teams, and rapid prototyping

 **For more details, read [Agent Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)**

## Seamless Development to Production

SRE lets you use the same agent logic in development and production and only change the runtime configuration, not your business logic.

```typescript
// Development setup
const sre = SRE.init({
    Cache: { Connector: 'RAM' },
    Storage: { Connector: 'Local' },
});
```

```typescript
// Production setup
const sre = SRE.init({
    Cache: { Connector: 'Redis', Settings: { url: '...' } },
    Storage: { Connector: 'S3', Settings: { bucket: '...' } },
});
```

Your agent workflows and skills remain unchanged across environments.

## Studio, SDK, or CLI?

| Workflow | Best For | Strengths | Limitations |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Studio | Rapid prototyping, low-code teams | Visual, intuitive, instant feedback | Less flexible for custom logic |
| SDK | Developers, CI/CD, full control | Custom logic, type-safe, versioning | Needs coding, steeper learning |
| CLI | Automation, scripting, quick tests | Fast, scriptable, works with both | Not visual, command-line only |

<InfoCallout title="How teams use this">
Start in Studioto ideate, switch to SDK for scale and integration, and automate with CLI for pipelines and testing.
