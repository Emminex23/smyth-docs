# Agent Studio Canvas

The SmythOS Agent Studio Canvas is a powerful visual interface that enables you to build, deploy, and monitor AI agents through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. This guide will help you understand the key features and capabilities of the Canvas.
## Interface Overview

The Canvas interface has three main areas:

- **Left sidebar**: Access Weaver, Components, Integrations, Deployment History, and Agent Settings for managing authentication, LLM configuration, and more
- **Central canvas**: Visual workspace where you build your agent workflow
- **Right sidebar**: Component configuration and testing panels for detailed setup and validation

The central canvas serves as your primary workspace for connecting components into complex AI agent behaviors. While you're building, the canvas automatically saves your work as drafts. When you're ready to test your logic, use the inspect button to access real-time monitoring and debugging tools. Once you're satisfied with your agent's performance, manage deployment versions through the deployments tab in the left sidebar to push your work to production.

## Building Workflows

Building an agent workflow follows a straightforward process:

1. **Drag & Drop**: Select components from the library and place them on the canvas
2. **Connect Components**: Create logical flows by connecting component inputs and outputs
3. **Configure Settings**: Customize component behavior using the right sidebar properties panel
4. **Validate Connections**: The Canvas automatically validates component compatibility
5. **Test Components**: Use the built-in testing tools to verify component behavior before deployment

As you build, components can reference data from previous components that have already executed. This creates dynamic workflows where results flow seamlessly from one step to the next, enabling sophisticated AI agent behaviors.
> The Canvas includes a comprehensive library of pre-built components including latest LLM models, RAG, Processing tools, and integrations. Learn more about components [components page].

## Deployment & Versioning

The Canvas follows a draft-to-production workflow to ensure stability. While the canvas auto-saves your work as drafts, only **deployed versions** actually run in production environments.

To deploy an agent:

1. Click **Deploy** when you're ready to go live
2. Add release notes to document your changes
3. Confirm to create a versioned release
4. Roll back to any previous version if issues arise

This approach lets you experiment and iterate safely without disrupting live agents.

### Version Control Features

- **Draft Management**: Work on multiple drafts simultaneously without affecting production
- **Version History**: Track all changes and deployments over time
- **Release Notes**: Document what changed in each deployment
- **Rollback**: Easily revert to previous stable versions
- **Environment Management**: Deploy to different environments (development, staging, production)

## Monitor & Debug

Debugging capabilities are incredibly advanced—you can step through and test your workflow with extreme granularity, similar to IDE debugging. The inspect section at the bottom lets you preview individual run logs and monitor costs and latency in real-time.

- **Logs**: View detailed component-level inputs, outputs, statuses, and errors
- **Run History**: Filter runs by success, failures, or duration to identify patterns
- **Run Preview**: Step through each component before deploying to catch issues early
- **Alerts**: Send failure or performance alerts to Slack, email, or other channels

### Advanced Monitoring

- **Real-time Metrics**: Track performance, latency, and resource usage as workflows execute
- **Component Analytics**: Analyze individual component performance to identify bottlenecks
- **Usage Statistics**: Monitor API calls, resource consumption, and costs
- **Custom Dashboards**: Create personalized monitoring views for your specific needs

## Error Handling

Configure **error handler** components that run automatically on any failure—regardless of control flow. This ensures your agents can gracefully handle unexpected situations.

Common error handling patterns include:

- **Retry policies**: Automatically retry failed operations up to N attempts
- **Notifications**: Send alerts via Slack, email, or other channels when errors occur
- **Fallback logic**: Use cached data or default values when primary operations fail

### Error Management Features

- **Global Error Handlers**: Set up system-wide error handling that applies to all components
- **Component-specific Handlers**: Configure targeted error handling for specific components
- **Error Recovery**: Define automatic recovery procedures to minimize downtime
- **Error Logging**: Detailed error tracking and analysis to improve your workflows over time
