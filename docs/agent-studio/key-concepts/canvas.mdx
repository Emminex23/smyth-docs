# Studio Canvas

The Studio Canvas is your main workspace for building, connecting, and testing AI agent workflows. You can drag components, wire them together, configure logic, and inspect behavior—all from one interface.

## Canvas Layout

When you open an agent in Studio, the screen is divided into three key areas:

- **Left sidebar**: Navigate tabs like Components, Agent Settings, Deployment History, Templates, and Vault.
- **Canvas workspace**: The visual editor where you arrange and connect components.
- **Right sidebar**: Configure individual components, test input/output, and inspect settings.

<InfoCallout title="Auto-Save Enabled">
Your work is saved automatically as a draft. Drafts don’t affect production agents until deployed.
</InfoCallout>

## Component Placement Guidelines

### Valid Drop Zones
Components must be placed within the designated canvas area for proper functionality.

### Invalid Placement Warning
When attempting to drop components outside the canvas area, you'll see:

- **Warning Message**: "Oops! you are dropping this component off the Canvas - please drop it inside"
- **Behavior**: The tooltip appears briefly and auto-dismisses
- **Result**: No component is added to the workflow

## Building Workflows

You build workflows directly on the canvas by connecting reusable components. Each workflow defines how your agent processes input and produces a result.

- Drag components from the sidebar onto the canvas
- Connect output ports to input ports to pass data between steps
- Configure individual components in the right panel

Read the [Building Workflows](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/building-workflows) guide to explore advanced tips, trigger types, external integrations, and best practices for authoring AI workflows,

## Deploying Agents

Once you’re satisfied with your workflow:

1. Click [**Deploy**](/docs/agent-deployments/overview) in the top-right.
2. Add release notes to describe the version.
3. Confirm to push your agent to production.
4. Use [**version history**](/docs/agent-deployments/versioning) to roll back if needed.

## Monitoring and Debugging

Inspect lets you preview and debug workflows without deploying.

- **Component preview**: Click any component to see inputs and outputs
- **Run history**: Review previous executions and filter by success/failure
- **Logs view**: Jump directly to detailed logs for each run

> **Need Production Logs?** Visit [Agent Logs](/docs/agent-studio/manage-agents/logs) for deeper visibility into executions.

## Error Handling

You can define error handling for any step in your workflow—or globally.

### Options include:

- **Retry policies**: Retry a component N times on failure
- **Fallback paths**: Provide defaults or cached data
- **Notifications**: Alert users via email or Slack
- **Global error handler**: Catch all uncaught errors at the workflow level

<TipCallout title="Best Practice">
Add fallback logic and alerts to reduce downtime and improve agent resilience.
</TipCallout>

## Mobile Experience 

When accessing the SmythOS canvas on devices with screen widths smaller than 1024px, you’ll encounter a **Mobile Experience Limited** warning modal. This appears because the canvas interface relies on ample screen space for effective workflow building.

Small screens limit usability when:

- Arranging and wiring components  
- Accessing input/output fields  
- Configuring settings panels  

For the best experience, use devices with screen widths of **1024px or larger**.

### Modal Options

The warning modal offers the following options:

1. **Copy Link to Desktop** – Copies the current URL for opening on a desktop.
2. **Email Link to Myself** – Sends the current canvas link to your registered email address.
3. **Continue Anyway** – Dismisses the modal and allows limited use on mobile.
4. **Do Not Show Again** – Hides the modal in future sessions on the same device.

### Additional Resources

At the bottom of the modal:

- **Documentation Link** – Directs to relevant SmythOS docs.
- **Contact Support Link** – Opens an invite to the SmythOS Discord community.
