# Local Docker Setup for Studio

This guide will get you running with a private, local version of **Studio** using Docker. The entire process takes just a few minutes.

<InfoCallout title="Why Run It Locally?">
You get **full control, total privacy, and offline access.** It's the perfect sandbox for experimenting with agents, connecting to local data, and developing without limits.
</InfoCallout>

The full project is open-source and available on our [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio).

## What You'll Need

Before you start, make sure you have these three things ready:

1.  **Docker Desktop:** This is the engine that runs your local studio. If you don't have it, you can download it for free from the [official Docker website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
3.  **An LLM API Key:** Agents need a "brain" to function. You'll need an API key from a provider like OpenAI to enable your agents to process and generate language.

## The 3-Step Setup

This setup uses Docker Compose to automatically create and connect all the necessary services for you.

### 1. Get the Project Code

First, open VS Code (or any IDE) and launch its integrated terminal (you can use the `Terminal > New Terminal` menu option). Run the following command to download the source code from the [SmythOS Studio repository](https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio) and open the project folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio.git
cd smythos-studio
```

### 2. Configure Your Environment

This is the most important step. You'll create a private configuration file and add your secret API key.

A. First, in the VS Code terminal, copy the example configuration file to a new file named <code>.env</code>. This file is safely ignored by version control, so your secrets are never exposed.

```bash
cp .env.compose.example .env
```

B. Now, use the VS Code file explorer to find and open the new <code>.env</code> file. Add your LLM API key to enable your agents' core functionality.

```text
# Add this to your .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-YourSecretAPIKeyGoesHere"
```

### 3. Launch the Studio

With your configuration saved, you are ready to launch. Run the command below in the VS Code terminal to build and start your studio. The <code>-d</code> flag tells Docker to run everything in the background.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The first launch may take several minutes while Docker downloads all the components. To monitor the progress or check for errors, you can view the live logs with this command:

```bash
# Optional: View the live logs
docker compose logs -f
```

Once the logs show that the services are healthy and running, your studio is live. Open your browser and navigate to:

**<code>http://localhost</code>**

Congratulations, you're now running SmythOS Studio locally!

## Common Questions & Fixes

-   **How do I stop everything?**
    To stop and remove all the running containers, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run <code>docker compose down</code>.

-   **I got a "port is already allocated" error.**
    This common error means another program on your computer is already using a port that Docker needs (usually port 80). Find and stop the other program (common culprits are other web servers or development tools) and try launching the studio again.

-   **Where can I learn about a full production setup?**
    This guide is optimized for a simple local setup. For deploying to a server with your own domain, SSL, and enhanced security, please refer to the **[Full Docker Deployment Guide](https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio/blob/main/DOCKER_COMPOSE.md)** in our repository. If you encounter issues not covered here, you can also check the project's [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SmythOS/smythos-studio/issues).
