# Introduction to Studio

**Studio** is where you design, test, and launch intelligent agents in SmythOS without writing code. You decide the logic, connect the data, and control how your agent thinks and acts.

<InfoCallout title="What Is Studio?">
Studio is the central platform in SmythOS for building, managing, and deploying agents. It brings together a visual drag-and-drop [Canvas](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/canvas.mdx), secure [Vault](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault) for credentials, agent management tools, data storage, and deployment options in one place.

## What You Can Do in Studio

You can use Studio to:

- Build custom workflows with logic, memory, and multi-step reasoning  
- Connect to APIs, internal tools, and third-party platforms  
- Automate repetitive tasks across data, content, and support workflows  
- Deploy agents to run in production via chat, API, or webhooks  
- Test, debug, and monitor everything in a single environment

## Common Workflows in Studio

SmythOS agents are flexible. Here are some ways users typically apply them:

- **Customer Support Agents**: Handle FAQs, resolve requests, and escalate when needed.  
- **Data Processing Pipelines**: Collect, clean, analyze, and forward data automatically.  
- **Search and Summarization Agents**: Combine web tools, LLMs, and [Data Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/data-pool/data-spaces) for insights.  
- **Content Moderation Flows**: Review and filter content according to your business rules.
