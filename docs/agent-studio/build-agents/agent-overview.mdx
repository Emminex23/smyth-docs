# Agent Overview

In **SmythOS**, an **agent** is a packaged workflow that can **reason**, **act**, and **respond** across multiple channels (API, chat, voice, batch).  
Agent orchestration is the practice of **designing, running, and governing** these agents so they meet your product and operational needs. In SmythOS, we provide not just the tools to create but also powerful orchestration features. 

## Core Concepts

| Term | What it means |
|------|--------------------------|
| **Component** | The smallest building block—one task with defined inputs ➜ outputs.<br/>_Examples: API Call, GenAI-LLM, Web Scraper, RAG Search._ |
| **Skill** | A reusable **bundle of components** wired together to solve a sub-task (e.g., "Enrich a company record" or "Summarize a PDF"). Import a skill once; drop it into many agents. |
| **Agent** | A production-ready package that stitches **multiple skills** into a full workflow, adds memory, auth, and deployment metadata, and exposes REST / WebSocket / UI endpoints. |
| **Vault** | An encrypted locker for API keys and secrets, referenced by components at runtime so credentials never leak. |

> **TL;DR** – *Components* ⟶ bundled into *Skills* ⟶ orchestrated by an *Agent* you can ship to users.

## What an agent gives you

| Capability | Why it matters |
|------------|----------------|
| **Token-based REST & WebSocket APIs** | Call your agent from backend or frontend code in a single line. |
| **Hosted Web UI** | SmythOS auto-generates a polished chat or form UI you can embed or white-label. |
| **Visual Builder & Prompt Ops** | Tune prompts, swap LLMs, inspect token logs—no redeploy needed. |
| **Observability & Annotation** | Real-time run logs, cost tracing, and human-in-the-loop evaluation. |
| **Deployment controls** | Versioning, staged roll-outs, RBAC.|

## Agent flavors

| Type | Best for | Interaction mode | Default UI | Example Endpoint |
|------|----------|------------------|------------|------------------|
| **Chat Agent** | Conversational assistants, support bots | Multi-turn dialog, memory on | Chat window | `/v1/agents/{id}/chat` |
| **Task Agent** | Autonomous task chains, tool calls | Decompose → act → summarize | Log timeline | `/v1/agents/{id}/run` |
| **Chatflow** | Complex multi-round dialog with conditional branches | State-aware, memory | Chat window | `/v1/chatflows/{id}/chat` |
| **Workflow** | Single-shot automation & batch jobs | One-and-done | Form + result | `/v1/workflows/{id}/invoke` |

### Chat Agent vs. Task Agent

| Feature | Chat Agent | Task Agent |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Context persistence** | Continuous | Optional / per run |
| **Tool invocation** | Limited (FAQ, RAG) | Full autonomy, external APIs |
| **Streaming output** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Example use-case** | Customer-support bot | Lead-enrichment pipeline |

## Common use-cases

- **Customer Service** – Classify intent ➜ retrieve KB docs ➜ draft, stream, and log replies.  
- **Content Generation** – Outline ➜ research ➜ generate ➜ style-check ➜ deliver.  
- **Task Automation** – Trigger from Slack ➜ process data ➜ update Jira ➜ notify stakeholder.  
- **Data Analysis** – Ingest CSV ➜ run SQL or Pandas ➜ summarize insights ➜ return chart.  
- **Email Automation** – Draft, personalize, and queue sends at scale.

## Get started in 4 steps

1. **Create a new agent** from the dashboard or clone a [template](/docs/agent-templates/overview).  
2. **Design the workflow**: drag nodes, wire inputs/outputs, and set memory or tool calls.  
3. **Publish** ➜ SmythOS assigns an agent ID and generates API keys/scopes.  
4. **Trigger** the agent via UI **or** call the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.smythos.com/v1/agents/{agent_id}/run \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SMYTH_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"inputs": {"query": "Generate five tagline ideas for SmythOS"}}'
