# Introduction

Welcome to Agent Studio â€” your home base for building, running, and scaling AI agents with SmythOSâ€”the horizontal orchestration layer that fuses LLMs, reasoners, and enterprise-grade guardrails into one secure, human-supervised workflow engine.

These docs walk you through everything from a 2-minute Quickstart to deep dives on advanced topics like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), multi-LLM routing, observability, and self-hosted runtime deployment.

> Our documentation is a work in progress. We ship fast and document just as quicklyâ€”pull requests, issues, and typo fixes are always welcome. Letâ€™s make agent development easier for everyone.
