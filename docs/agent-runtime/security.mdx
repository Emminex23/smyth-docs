# SRE Security Model

SRE is built with security at its core. Every action is evaluated against role-based permissions, access control lists, and identity-aware rules. You don’t need to bolt on external layers; SRE provides enterprise-grade security by default.

<InfoCallout title="Security is built-in">
Every request in SRE passes through a permission check. Only verified identities with the right role and access policy can read, write, or execute.
</InfoCallout>

## Identity Enforcement with Candidates and ACLs

At the heart of SRE’s access system is the **Candidate and ACL model**:

-   A `Candidate` is an identity. This could be an agent, a user, or even a specific tool or task.
-   An **Access Control List (ACL)** maps each candidate to what actions they are allowed to perform.

Every time a candidate tries to access a resource, like storage, a model, or an API, SRE checks the ACL first.

```typescript
// Example: Agent writing to storage with ACL enforcement
const candidate = AccessCandidate.agent(agentId);
const storage = ConnectorService.getStorageConnector().user(candidate);
await storage.write('results.json', data);
```

You can assign these permissions through [Roles and Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions), and they apply across [Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces) and your [Organization](/docs/account-management/organization-management).

## Vault-Based Secret Management

Sensitive values like API keys, passwords, and tokens are never hardcoded in SRE. Instead, they are stored in the **[SmythOS Vault](/docs/sre/vault)**:

-   Vaults encrypt data at rest and in transit.
-   You can use built-in or external vault providers such as `AWS Secrets Manager` or `HashiCorp Vault`.
-   Role-scoped access ensures only approved agents or users can fetch secrets.
-   Every access is logged for compliance and debugging.

→ To manage secrets directly, go to your **[Vault dashboard](/docs/sre/vault)**.

## Authentication and Identity Providers

SRE supports secure login using both built-in accounts and external providers:

-   Integrate enterprise systems with **SSO** or **LDAP**.
-   Add [custom account connectors](/docs/sre/sdk-guide) to fit into your existing authentication flow.
-   Use token-based login with secure expiration and refresh logic.

You can manage users and their authentication status from the **[Organization Management panel](/docs/account-management/organization-management)**.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is used throughout SmythOS, from the agent runtime to your admin dashboard. It defines **who can do what**, across both **[Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)** and your broader organization.

In SRE, roles are enforced in real time. If a candidate does not have the correct permissions, the action is denied before it begins.

Roles are scoped to:

-   **Organization-wide roles** like `Super Admin`
-   **Space-specific roles** like `Admin`, `Editor`, and `Viewer`

→ To adjust or assign roles, see the **[Roles and Permissions guide](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions)**.

## Enterprise Security Features

SRE supports production-grade environments with hardened defaults:

-   **TLS/SSL encryption** is applied across all internal and external communication.
-   **Audit logs** capture every critical operation including agent runs, data access, and vault usage.
-   **Vault secrets** can be automatically rotated and revoked.
-   **Default policies** enforce least privilege and deny unknown actions.

→ To deploy in regulated environments, see **[Enterprise Deployment](/docs/sre/enterprise-deploy)**.

<WarningCallout title="Review policies regularly">
Security is shared between the platform and the user. Review your ACL rules, vault usage, and analytics logs periodically to catch misconfigurations or leaks.

## How This All Connects

Here’s how different areas of SmythOS work together to create a secure runtime:

| Security Area | Where It’s Managed |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Identity and ACLs** | [Roles and Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) |
| **Credential Storage** | [Vault](/docs/sre/vault) |
| **User Roles and Login**| [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management) |
| **Agent Environments** | [Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces) |
| **Advanced Deployment**| [Enterprise Deployment](/docs/sre/enterprise-deploy) |
