# Security in SRE

The **Smyth Runtime Environment (SRE)** is built with zero-trust security at its core. Every action is evaluated against role-based permissions, access control lists, and identity-aware rules. You don’t need to bolt on external layers. SRE provides enterprise-grade security by default.

<InfoCallout title="Security is built-in">
Every request in SRE passes through a permission check. Only verified identities with the right role and access policy can read, write, or execute.
</InfoCallout>

## Identity Enforcement with Candidates and ACLs

At the heart of SRE’s access system is the **Candidate and ACL model**:

- A **Candidate** is an identity. This could be an agent, a user, or even a specific tool or task.
- An **Access Control List (ACL)** maps each candidate to what actions they are allowed to perform.

Every time a candidate tries to access a resource, like storage, a model, or an API... SRE checks the ACL first.

```ts
// Example: Agent writing to storage with ACL enforcement
const candidate = AccessCandidate.agent(agentId);
const storage = ConnectorService.getStorageConnector().user(candidate);
await storage.write('results.json', data);
```

You can assign these permissions through [Roles and Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions), and they apply across [Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces) and your [Organization](/docs/account-management/organization-management).

## Vault-Based Secret Management

Sensitive values like API keys, passwords, and tokens are never hardcoded in SRE. Instead, they are stored in [Vaults](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault):

- Vaults encrypt data at rest and in transit
- You can use built-in or external vault providers such as AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault
- Role-scoped access ensures only approved agents or users can fetch secrets
- Every access is logged for compliance and debugging

To manage secrets directly, go to your [Vault dashboard](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault).

## Authentication and Identity Providers

SRE supports secure login using both built-in accounts and external providers:

- Integrate enterprise systems with SSO or LDAP
- Add [custom account connectors](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide) to fit into your existing authentication flow
- Use token-based login with secure expiration and refresh logic

You can manage users and their authentication status from the [Organization Management panel](/docs/account-management/organization-management).

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

RBAC is used throughout SmythOS; from the agent runtime to your admin dashboard. It defines **who can do what**, across both [Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces) and your broader organization.

In SRE, roles are enforced in real time. If a candidate does not have the correct permissions, the action is denied before it begins.

Roles are scoped to:

- **Organization-wide roles** like Super Admin
- **Space-specific roles** like Admin, Editor, and Viewer

To adjust or assign roles, go to the [Roles and Permissions guide](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions).

## Enterprise Security Features

SRE supports production-grade environments with hardened defaults:

- TLS/SSL encryption is applied across all internal and external communication
- Audit logs capture every critical operation including agent runs, data access, and vault usage
- Vault secrets can be automatically rotated and revoked
- Default policies enforce least privilege and deny unknown actions

To deploy in regulated environments, see [Enterprise Deployment](/docs/agent-runtime/enterprise-deploy).

<WarningCallout title="Review policies regularly">
Security is shared between platform and user. Review your [ACL rules](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions), vault usage, and [analytics logs](/docs/agent-collaboration/analytics) periodically to catch misconfigurations or leaks.
</WarningCallout>

## How This All Connects

Here’s how different areas of SRE work together to create a secure runtime:

| Security Area         | Where It’s Managed                             |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Identity and ACLs     | [Roles and Permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/permissions) |
| Credential Storage    | [Vaults](/docs/agent-studio/key-concepts/vault)                      |
| User Roles and Login  | [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management) |
| Agent and Space Setup | [Spaces](/docs/agent-collaboration/spaces)     |
| Advanced Deployment   | [Enterprise Deployment](/docs/agent-runtime/enterprise-deploy) |
