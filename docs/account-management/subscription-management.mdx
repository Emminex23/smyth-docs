# Subscription Management

The [**My Plan**](https://app.smythos.com/my-plan) page lets you manage your subscription tier, usage limits, billing caps, and cancellation settings. You can access it anytime from the top-right menu of your SmythOS dashboard.

<InfoCallout title="Where to manage your plan">
Click your profile picture, choose **My Plan**, and manage everything from credit usage to cancellation in one place.
</InfoCallout>

## View Plan and Usage

At the top of the **My Plan** page, you'll see a summary of your active plan:

| Section             | Description                                                  |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Plan Details**     | Your subscription tier, renewal date, and team ownership     |
| **Model Use**       | [Credits](/docs/account-management/billing-management) consumed this cycle |
| **Data Pool Usage** | GB of storage used out of your quota                         |
| **Active Agents**   | Total agents deployed during this billing cycle              |

<InfoCallout title="Credit resets">
Credits renew at the start of each billing cycle. Plan multipliers affect how much each action costs.
</InfoCallout>

For detailed model pricing, see the [Billing Management](/docs/account-management/billing-management) page.

## Set a Billing Limit

You can prevent overages by enabling a billing cap:

1. Scroll to the **Set Billing Limit** section
2. Toggle the feature ON
3. Enter a USD threshold

Once your usage exceeds the included credits **and** hits the limit, charges stop.

<WarningCallout title="Limits apply after credits are used">
Credits are always consumed first. Paid billing begins only when your usage goes beyond your plan’s quota.
</WarningCallout>

To monitor usage, check the [Analytics Dashboard](/docs/agent-collaboration/user-management).

## Cancel a Subscription
<InfoCallout title="Only team owners can cancel subscriptions">
If you don’t see the cancel option, check your [role and permissions](/docs/agent-collaboration/user-management). Only the [team owner](/docs/account-management/organization-management) has permission to cancel the plan.
</InfoCallout>
To downgrade your plan:

1. Open **My Plan**  
2. Scroll to **Cancel Subscription**  
3. Click **Cancel Subscription**  
4. Complete the Stripe cancellation flow

Your account will remain active until the end of your current billing cycle. After that, it will move to the [Free Forever tier](https://smythos.com/pricing/).

<Spacer size="md" />

<WarningCallout title="Important"> 
Only the team owner can cancel the subscription.  
If you're **not** the team owner and try to cancel, **nothing will happen**.  
Ask your team owner to cancel on your behalf.
</WarningCallout>

## Subscription Cancellation Behavior

### What Happens After You Cancel

- **Continued Access:** You keep full access until the billing cycle ends  
- **UI Indicators:** Subscription appears as “scheduled for cancellation”  
- **Stripe Status:** Check the Stripe portal for confirmation  

### Downgrade Notifications

When your account switches to the Free tier:

- You’ll receive an automatic downgrade email  
- The email includes new plan limits  
- Review feature access on the [Plans and Pricing](https://smythos.com/pricing) page

### Billing Period Notes

- Paid features remain available until the cycle ends  
- No additional charges occur after cancellation  
- Track your billing status via Stripe

## Role-Based Access

Plan management is permission-based:

- **Team Owner:** Full access to cancel subscriptions  
- **Super Admins:** Can manage limits, view usage  
- **Members/Viewers:** Cannot access subscription settings

Roles are managed via [Organization Management](/docs/account-management/organization-management).
