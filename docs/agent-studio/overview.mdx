# Introduction

<InfoCallout title="What is Agent Studio?">
**Agent Studio** is a cloud-based visual builder for creating and managing agents in SmythOS. Use modular [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components) to define workflows that control how agents reason and act. Connect LLMs, enterprise data, and third-party tools into secure, human-guided automations.
This guide covers everything from a 2-minute quickstart to advanced topics like [RAG](/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-search), multi-LLM routing, and [production deployment](/docs/agent-deployments/overview).

# Features of Studio

Agent Studio is a visual canvas designed to simplify the creation of complex AI agents. It provides a suite of tools that let you:

* **Visualize Workflows:** Instantly test, inspect, and refine your agent's logic as you build.
* **Integrate Seamlessly:** Connect your agent to any process on the internet, from internal tools using [webhooks](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-webhook) to thousands of third-party APIs.
* **Handle Multiple Inputs:** Define custom inputs and outputs to process text, images, files, and structured data.
* **Build with AI:** Leverage advanced components for classification, reasoning, and autonomous decision-making.
* **Customize Everything:** Modify every aspect of your agent, from its core logic to its final [deployment](/docs/agent-deployments/overview), with unparalleled control.
