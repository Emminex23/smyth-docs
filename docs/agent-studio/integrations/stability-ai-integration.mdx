### <a name="image-enhancement-tools"></a>Image Enhancement & Video Tools
Components like **Image to Image Upscale**, **Creative Upscale**, and **Image to Video** enhance or animate your images. Note that some of these are asynchronous.

<InfoCallout>These components require an `API Key` for authentication, as detailed in the [Getting Started](#getting-started-with-stability-ai) section.</InfoCallout>

#### Common Inputs & Asynchronous Flow
- **Inputs:** Typically require an `image_binary` and may have other parameters like `width` or `creativity`.
- **Asynchronous Flow:** Some processes (like `Creative Upscale` and `Image to Video`) are asynchronous.
    1. You first call the main component (e.g., `Image to Video`). It returns an `id`.
    2. You must then use this `id` as input to the corresponding "Get Result" component (e.g., `Get Image to Video Result`).
    3. The "Get Result" component will return the final `url` once processing is complete.

#### Outputs
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string | (For async jobs) The ID of the generation process. |
| `url` | string | (For sync jobs or "Get Result") The direct URL to the final asset. |
| `Response`| object | The raw JSON response from the Stability AI API. |
| `Headers` | object | The HTTP headers from the API response. |


<TipCallout title="Use Case: Upscaling" collapsible>
An agent takes a low-resolution user avatar, runs it through the **Image to Image Upscale** component with a target `width` of 1024, and updates the user's profile with the new high-resolution version.
</TipCallout>

```json
// Step 1: Start the Job
{
  "component": "stabilityai.imageToVideo",
  "image_binary": "path/to/your/image.png",
  "motion_bucket_id": 150
}
// Output from Step 1 will contain an "id"

// Step 2: Get the Result
{
  "component": "stabilityai.getImageToVideoResult",
  "id": "id-from-previous-step"
}
```

<WarningCallout title="Handle Asynchronous Jobs">
For components that return an `id`, you must build a two-step process in your agent. A simple approach is to add a delay after the first call, then call the "Get Result" component.
</WarningCallout>

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Key:** Always store your Stability AI API key in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Understand Model Differences:** The SD3 and Core models have different strengths. Experiment to see which model and style preset works best for your prompts.
* **Master Prompting:** For all generative tasks, the prompt is the most important input. Be descriptive. Include details about subject, style, lighting, and composition. Use the `negative_prompt` to exclude unwanted elements.
* **Check API Costs:** Image generation and editing consume credits from your Stability AI account. Be aware of the cost of different operations and monitor your usage in your Stability AI dashboard.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Key is incorrect, missing, or invalid.
  * **Solution:** Verify the API Key in your SmythOS Vault is correct and active in your Stability AI account.

* **Error: `400 Bad Request` / Validation Error**
  * **Cause:** An input is missing, has the wrong data type, or is outside the allowed range (e.g., image dimensions not divisible by 64).
  * **Solution:** Carefully check all inputs against the component's requirements. For image dimensions, ensure they are valid. For prompts, ensure they are not empty.

* **Asynchronous Job Never Completes**
  * **Cause:** The generation task may have failed on Stability AI's end, or the job is taking a very long time.
  * **Solution:** Check the status of the job via the raw `Response` from the "Get Result" component. If it remains in a "processing" state for an extended period, try the request again. Check Stability AI's status page for any ongoing issues.

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful visual automation workflows with the **SmythOS Stability AI Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Automatically generates featured images for new blog posts based on the post's title and a summary.
    * Creates a product personalization tool. A user uploads a photo of their room, and the agent uses `Search and Replace` to show how a new piece of furniture would look in their space.
    * Monitors a folder for new product photos, automatically removes the background, upscales the image, and then creates a short animated video of the product for social media.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Use an LLM from [OpenRouter](/docs/integrations/openrouter) to generate creative, detailed prompts to feed into Stability AI's text-to-image components.
    * Generate an image with Stability AI and then use a voice from [Elevenlabs](/docs/integrations/elevenlabs) to describe it.
    * Create a workflow where users can describe an image in a chat, and the agent generates it and sends it back via [Slack](/docs/integrations/slack).
