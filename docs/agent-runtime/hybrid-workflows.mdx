# Hybrid Workflows in SRE

SRE supports both visual and code-based agent development. You are not locked into one way of working; you can use **[Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)**, the **[SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)**, or combine them for maximum efficiency.

<InfoCallout title="Why hybrid workflows matter">
Studio gives you speed and clarity. The SDK gives you full control and custom logic. Hybrid workflows let you design in one place, extend in another, and keep everything working as one agent.
</InfoCallout>

## The Hybrid Advantage

Some tasks are easier visually, like laying out logic or sharing ideas with non-technical teammates. Others need the power of version-controlled code and deep integrations. **Hybrid workflows let you do both without compromise.**

This approach is ideal if you:

-   Want to **prototype fast** in a visual canvas but **scale in code**.
-   Work in **cross-functional teams** (e.g., product + engineering).
-   Need **visual clarity** for core logic but **code control** for custom extensions.
-   Use Studio for testing and observability, but the SDK for CI/CD.

### Best Tool for the Job

| Use Case | Best Tool | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Rapid Prototyping | **[Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)** | Drag components and test agent flows instantly. |
| CI/CD & Version Control | **[SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)** | Store your agent's definition in a Git repository. |
| Custom Logic & Integrations | **[SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)** | Build a custom skill that queries a private API. |
| Non-Technical Collaboration | **[Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)** | Let business users shape and review logic visually. |
| Schema Enforcement & Testing| **[SDK](/docs-agent-runtime/sdk-guide)** | Add type checks to your agent’s response flow. |

## Exporting from Studio to the SDK

<InfoCallout title="How it works: Portable Agent Schema" collapsible>
Studio agents are stored as structured JSON. This makes them portable and editable in both code and visual environments. For example, a connection you draw between two components is defined as data, allowing it to be imported and understood by the SDK.

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "sourceId": "llm_1",
      "targetId": "classifier_1",
      "sourceIndex": 0,
      "targetIndex": 0
    }
  ]
}
```
</InfoCallout>

You can take any agent built visually in Studio and bring it into a code-based workflow. First, open the agent in Studio and use the keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl + Shift + E` or `⌘ + Shift + E`) to export its definition as a `.smyth` file.

Once the file is in your project, you can load it directly into the SDK to create a fully functional agent instance that mirrors your visual design.

```typescript
import { SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';
import agentData from './my-agent.smyth';

// Load the agent definition from the exported file
const agent = new SDK.Agent(agentData);

// You can now interact with the agent just like any other SDK-based agent
const result = await agent.prompt('Give me a summary.');
console.log(result);
```

This is powerful because you can then programmatically extend the agent with new skills, run automated tests, or integrate it into a larger backend process.

The following complete example shows how to load an agent, add a new custom skill that wasn't part of the visual design, and then create a workflow that uses both the agent's original abilities and the new skill.

```typescript
import { SRE, SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';

async function main() {
  // 1. Initialize the SRE runtime for a local environment.
  console.log('Initializing SRE...');
  const sre = SRE.init({
    Cache: { Connector: 'RAM' },
    Storage: { Connector: 'Local' },
    Log: { Connector: 'ConsoleLog' },
  });
  await sre.ready();
  console.log('SRE is ready.\n');

  // 2. Load the agent from the .smyth file exported from Studio.
  console.log('Loading agent from file...');
  // Note: For this to run, you need a my-agent.smyth file.
  // We will create a dummy agent here for demonstration.
  const agent = new SDK.Agent({
    name: 'AINewsAnalystAgent',
    model: 'gpt-4',
    behavior: 'You are a sharp AI industry analyst. You provide concise, data-driven insights on the latest AI news and its impact on the market.',
  });
  console.log(`Agent "${agent.name}" loaded.\n`);

  // 3. Programmatically extend the agent with a new skill.
  console.log('Adding custom skill "formatAIAnalysis"...');
  agent.addSkill({
    name: 'formatAIAnalysis',
    description: 'Formats a raw text analysis into a structured JSON report.',
    ai_exposed: false,
    process: async (rawAnalysisText) => {
      let sentiment = 'Neutral';
      if (rawAnalysisText.toLowerCase().includes('disruptive') || rawAnalysisText.toLowerCase().includes('significant')) {
        sentiment = 'Positive';
      } else if (rawAnalysisText.toLowerCase().includes('challenges') || rawAnalysisText.toLowerCase().includes('concerns')) {
        sentiment = 'Mixed';
      }
      return {
        analysis_summary: rawAnalysisText,
        market_sentiment: sentiment,
        report_generated_at: new Date().toISOString(),
      };
    },
  });
  console.log('Skill added successfully.\n');

  // 4. Prompt the agent about a trending topic.
  const topic = 'the release of the "Veo-3" AI model';
  console.log(`Prompting agent for analysis of ${topic}...`);
  const analysisText = await agent.prompt(`Analyze the market impact of ${topic}.`);
  console.log('--- Agent Raw Output ---\n', analysisText, '\n------------------------\n');

  // 5. Use the new custom skill to process the agent's output.
  console.log('Processing output with "formatAIAnalysis" skill...');
  const formattingSkill = agent.getSkill('formatAIAnalysis');
  const structuredReport = await formattingSkill.process(analysisText);

  // 6. Display the final, structured result.
  console.log('--- Final Structured Data ---\n', structuredReport, '\n---------------------------\n');
  console.log('Workflow complete.');
}

// Run the main function
main().catch(console.error);
```

## Importing from the SDK into Studio

You can take any SDK-defined agent and visualize, test, or debug it in Studio.

### Step-by-Step

1.  Build your agent in the SDK.
2.  Export its data structure to a file:

```typescript
import fs from 'fs';
import { SDK } from 'smyth-runtime';

const agent = new SDK.Agent({ name: 'HybridAgent', model: 'gpt-4' });

const agentData = agent.data;
fs.writeFileSync('agent-for-studio.json', JSON.stringify(agentData, null, 2));
```

3.  In Studio, go to **Create Agent → Import from File**.
4.  Drag the exported JSON file onto the canvas or use the upload prompt.

Studio will automatically load the logic, components, and configuration so you can inspect and extend it visually.

<WarningCallout title="Sync changes manually">
If you edit the agent’s structure in the SDK after importing, re-export and re-import the file into Studio to see the changes.
