# CLI Guide

The **SmythOS CLI** lets you build, test, and manage agents directly from your terminal.  
It’s ideal if you want faster iteration, automation, or integration into existing developer workflows.

<InfoCallout title="Why use the CLI?">
The CLI brings automation and speed to agent development.  
Use it to scaffold projects, run agents locally, export between Studio and SDK, and add agents to CI/CD pipelines.
</InfoCallout>

## Install the CLI

Install globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @smythos/cli
```

<WarningCallout title="Requirements">
- Node.js v18 or higher is required  
- Update the CLI regularly for the latest features and bug fixes  
</WarningCallout>

## Core Commands

These commands cover the majority of everyday tasks:

| Command      | Description                                           |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `sre create` | Scaffold a new SDK agent project with prompts         |
| `sre run`    | Run an agent (SDK code or `.smyth` file) locally      |
| `sre build`  | Compile and prepare your agent for deployment         |
| `sre export` | Convert SDK projects into `.smyth` files for Studio   |
| `sre help`   | List all commands and usage examples                  |

<InfoCallout title="Studio ↔ CLI ↔ SDK">
You can export a `.smyth` file from **Studio** and run it in the CLI, or start with the CLI and import into Studio.  
Both workflows are compatible.
</InfoCallout>

## Using the CLI in Practice

### 1. Scaffold a project

```bash
sre create
```

Follow the prompts to set language (TypeScript recommended), name your agent, and initialize project files.  

### 2. Run an agent from Studio export

If you exported an agent to `.smyth`:

```bash
sre run ./my-agent.smyth
```

The CLI loads the agent and executes it in your terminal.

### 3. Run your SDK agent

From within an SDK project directory:

```bash
sre run
```

Runs the project entrypoint (e.g. `index.ts`) and streams the output.  

### 4. Export for Studio

Convert your SDK project back into Studio format:

```bash
sre export
```

Generates a `.smyth` file ready to open visually.

<TipCallout title="No extra setup">
The CLI handles scaffolding, runtime, and export automatically.  
You only point it to your project or file.
</TipCallout>

## Automating with CLI Scripts

You can add CLI commands into npm scripts or shell scripts for automation.

**package.json example:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "sre run",
    "build": "sre build",
    "export": "sre export"
  }
}
```

Now you can run:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
```

<InfoCallout title="Use in CI/CD">
Add these scripts to your pipeline to automate testing, builds, and deployments.  
For real-world examples, see the [SRE repo](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre).

## Troubleshooting

- Run `sre help` for a full list of commands  
- Confirm Node.js v18+ is installed  
- Update regularly to avoid compatibility issues:

```bash
npm update -g @smythos/cli
```

If problems persist, check [SRE GitHub Issues](https://github.com/SmythOS/sre/issues).

<WarningCallout title="Tip for debugging">
If an agent fails to run, check whether it was exported correctly from Studio or initialized properly with the SDK.
