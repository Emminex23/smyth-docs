# White Labeling Your Agents

Offer your AI agents under your own brand. The white labeling feature in SmythOS allows you to replace our branding with your own, delivering a fully branded, seamless experience for your users across the UI, emails, and agent interfaces.

  **Note:** White labeling is available on the **Scaleup** plan and higher. See our [full plan comparison](/docs/account-management/overview) for details.

## Why White Label Your Agents?

Presenting a unified brand front is essential for building trust and reinforcing your company's value. White labeling is ideal for:

-   **Agencies and Consultants:** Provide clients with a branded portal to interact with the agents you build for them.
-   **Enterprise Teams:** Maintain brand consistency across all internal tools, ensuring employees have a familiar and cohesive user experience.
-   **Product Integration:** [Embed SmythOS agents](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-as-chatbot) into your own SaaS product so they look and feel like a native part of your application.
-   **Resellers:** Offer AI agent services under your own brand, leveraging the power of the SmythOS [platform](/docs/agent-studio/overview) as your backend engine.

## What You Can Customize

White labeling allows you to customize several key aspects of the user interface to match your brand identity:

-   **Custom Logos:** Replace the SmythOS logo with your own company logo. This is especially powerful within shared [Project Spaces](/docs/account-management/spaces-management), giving clients a fully branded environment.
-   **Custom Domains:** Host your agents on your own [custom subdomains](/docs/agent-deployments/subdomains), removing any mention of SmythOS from the URL for a truly native feel.
-   **Branded Emails:** (Coming Soon) Ensure that all system-generated emails, such as user invitations and notifications, are sent from your domain and feature your logo and color scheme.

## Getting Started

Custom branding is managed at the **Space** level, allowing you to have unique branding for each client or project.

1.  **Create a Dedicated Space** First, navigate to the [Project Space](/docs/account-management/spaces-management) you wish to brand. If you're setting this up for a new client, it's best practice to create a new, dedicated space for them.

2.  **Upload Your Company Logo** Within the space, go to **Space Settings**. Under the **Company Branding** section, you will find the option to **Change Logo**. Upload your company's logo here. It will now be visible to all members and guests of that specific space.

3.  **Configure Your Custom Domain** For a fully immersive experience, you should host your agents on a domain you own. Follow the guide to [deploy your agent to your own domain](/docs/agent-deployments/deployments/deploy-to-your-domain), which involves adding a CNAME record in your DNS settings.

4.  **Deploy Your Agent** Finally, [deploy your agent](/docs/agent-deployments/overview) and select your verified custom subdomain during the deployment process.

By combining a custom logo with a custom domain, you can deliver a completely white-labeled experience to your end-users.
