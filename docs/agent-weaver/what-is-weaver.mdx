# Weaver Overview: Build AI Agents with Chat

> **Weaver** is the natural language-first interface in **SmythOS** that lets you build, fix, and vibe-code AI agents simply by describing what you want.  
> Unlike traditional builder tools that ask you to think like a developer, Weaver is task-oriented: you describe goals; Weaver builds workflows.  
> It’s where prompt meets product... and your typing becomes *Smyth-ing*.


<InfoCallout>
**TL;DR:** Type a goal, and Weaver does the **prompt-based AI agent creation** for you. No drag-and-drop required.
</InfoCallout>

## Understand Agent Weaver in 3 Minutes

While **Studio** offers a drag-and-drop canvas for agent design, **Weaver** flips the starting point. It begins with conversation, a blank input box where you tell SmythOS what you need. From there, Weaver starts with conversation with you:

1. **You describe a goal**  
2. Weaver interprets the intent  
3. It suggests skills from the SmythOS library  
4. It auto-wires an executable workflow  
5. You test, tweak, and ship—without leaving chat

That makes Weaver the fastest way to **build AI agents in SmythOS**.

> **Agent Smyth Weaver** is the **no-code AI workflow builder** inside SmythOS that turns plain-language requests into deployable agents.  
> Tell it what you want → it assembles the skills, wires the logic, and lets you test in seconds.

## Why We Built Weaver: A No-Code Agent Orchestration Tool

Before Weaver, building an agent feltlike coding a backend from scratch: wiring APIs, managing logic, handling retries... all before the real work even started.
Now you just **ask** for what you want. Explain what you need to *Weave* your AI agent:

**Prompt → Skill Suggestions → Visual Flow → Live Test → Fix/Deploy**

It’s not just easier... it’s friendlier, faster, and far more forgiving for any **AI automation designer** who values speed over syntax.

>- All SmythOS plans (free and paid) include free credits to use tools in the app, including Agent Weaver.
>- **After exhausting credits:** Users are limited to 5 requests per 24 hours.
>- **Credit restoration:** Credits are automatically restored at the beginning of each month.

# Key Features of Weaver

## How Weaver Works

We call this flow **Chat-to-Agent**:

1. **Describe the agent**:  
   <PromptCard prompt= {`Create an agent that writes SEO articles and posts to WordPress.`}/>
2. **(Optionally) list its skills**:  
   <PromptCard prompt= {`The agent should have the following skills...It should write SEO-optimised articles, extract primary and secondary keywords, and post content to Wordpress.`}/>
3. **Weaver maps those into 3 components:**
- GenAI LLM (to write the article)
- Classifier (to extract keywords)
- APICall (to post the content)
4. **It wires them into a functional layout**... like magic, but with schema integrity. Weaver also sets names, descriptions, inputs, and outputs, ensuring clarity and relevance.
5. **Test the agent directly in chat.**
6. **Fix any breakage with a single click.**
7. **Deploy and go live without writing any code.**

> Weaver even lets you attach images or flow diagrams to describe what you want.  
> Great for visual thinkers, or folks who like whiteboarding their way through a build.

## Fixing with AI

Component break? Happens to the best of us. Weaver gives you:

- Input/output previews  
- A **"Fix with AI"** button  
- The ability to select and debug multiple components (`Cmd/Ctrl + click` is your friend)
- Weaver rewrites only what’s broken or selected -> Your agent keeps running; no blanket rebuild required.

<WarningCallout>
Weaver doesn’t try to fix the entire agent unless you ask it to.  
You’re always in control.
</WarningCallout>

## Inside Weaver: What’s Actually Happening under the LLM Orchestration Framework

Weaver combines:

- **Prompt parsing** to identify goals and intent  
- **Skill suggestion** based on our core component library  
- **Dependency mapping** to auto-wire your logic  
- **Live doc search** to answer product questions... yes, even *"How do I upgrade?"*

It’s fast, helpful, and never passive-aggressive.

## Who Uses Weaver?

- Ops leads converting checklists into automations  
- PMs prototyping in a **SmythOS AI design environment**  
- Analysts who want results, not infrastructure  
- Developers who’d rather start at 80 % than 0 %

If you’ve ever thought *“I know what I want, I just don’t know how to build it,”* Weaver’s for you.

## Built for Modularity

Agents in SmythOS consist of **skills** (logic blocks) and **components**. Weaver encourages:

- Task-based thinking (“extract keywords” > “run NLP”)  
- Smaller, focused agents  
- Reuse over reinvention

<InfoCallout>
When something breaks, fix that **component**, not the whole workflow.

## Key Concepts

| Term | Plain-English Meaning |
|------|----------------------|
| **Agent** | Task-running bot powered by LLMs & skills |
| **Skill** | Reusable function like “summarize text” |
| **Workflow** | Components linked by inputs/outputs |
| **Component** | Single block (`●` mandatory · `○` optional) |

<Divider/>

## When Components Run (or Don’t)

- **Runs** → all mandatory inputs connected  
- **Waits** → mandatory inputs unresolved  
- **Skips** → mandatory input missing → Weaver bypasses

Knowing this will help you keep the **no-code AI agent generation** smooth.

> This logic prevents agents from sitting idle just because you forgot to wire an optional line.
