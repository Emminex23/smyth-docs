  <summary>Why Integrate Serpstat with Your Agent?</summary>

Serpstat is a comprehensive SEO toolkit. Integrating it with SmythOS allows you to build powerful agents that can automate nearly every aspect of SEO research, analysis, and reporting.

- **Automate Competitor Analysis:** Create agents that run weekly to track your competitors' ranking keywords, new backlinks, and top pages, delivering a competitive intelligence report directly to you.
- **Streamline Keyword Research:** Build a workflow that takes a single "seed" keyword, uses `Related Keywords` and `Search Suggestions` to build a massive list of potential targets, and then filters that list based on volume and competition.
- **Automated Content Audits:** Use agents to find content gaps by comparing your domain's keywords to your competitors' with the `Missing Keywords` component, providing a ready-made list of content to create.
- **Automate SEO Reporting:** Schedule agents to fetch data from `Domain History`, `Backlinks Dynamics`, and `URL Rank Keywords` to build custom, automated reports on your site's SEO performance over time.

## Best Practices & Advanced Tips

* **Secure Your API Token:** Always store your Serpstat API Token in the SmythOS `Vault`.
* **Manage API Lines:** Serpstat's API usage is measured in "lines" or requests per day. The `left_lines` output is crucial for monitoring your consumption. Design agents to be efficient to stay within your plan's limits.
* **Use the `se` Parameter:** For accurate, localized data, always specify the search engine and region code (e.g., `g_uk` for Google UK, `g_ca` for Google Canada) in your requests.
* **Chain Components for Deep Insights:** The most powerful workflows combine components. For example, use `Domain Keywords` to find a competitor's top keyword, then use `URL Rank Keywords` to see which of their pages ranks for it, and finally use `Active Backlinks` on that URL to understand why it ranks well.

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

* **Error: `401 Unauthorized`**
  * **Cause:** The API Token is incorrect, invalid, or your Serpstat plan does not include API access.
  * **Solution:** Verify that the API Token in your SmythOS Vault is correct. Log in to your Serpstat account to confirm your subscription level and that the token is active.

* **Error: "You have reached the end of your line limit"**
  * **Cause:** You have exhausted your daily API request quota.
  * **Solution:** Check the `left_lines` output on previous successful calls. You must wait for your quota to reset (typically every 24 hours). Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits.

* **Empty `result_data`**
  * **Cause:** The query may genuinely have no data (e.g., a new domain with no keywords), or the `se` (search engine region) specified has no database for that query.
  * **Solution:** Double-check your inputs (`domain`, `keyword`, `se`). Test the same query in the Serpstat web application to see if data exists there.

<Divider />

## What's Next?

You are now ready to build powerful SEO intelligence workflows with the **SmythOS Serpstat Integration**!

Consider these ideas:
* **Build an Agent That...**
    * Creates a "Content Gap Analysis" report. It takes your domain and three competitor domains, uses `Domain Keywords` on all of them, and then identifies keywords that all three competitors rank for but you do not.
    * Automates outreach prospecting. The agent gets a list of top-ranking articles for a keyword using the `URL Rank Keywords` component, then finds their contact information using other tools.
    * Monitors for negative SEO. It runs the `Lost Backlinks` and `Malicious Domains Donors` components weekly and sends an alert if a significant number of valuable links are lost or new toxic links are found.

* **Explore Other Integrations:**
    * Combine Serpstat with an [LLM component](/docs/integrations/openrouter). Use `Related Keywords` to get a list of topics, then have the LLM write a draft article for the most promising one.
    * Feed the output of your Serpstat reports directly into a [Google Sheet](/docs/integrations/google-sheets) to create custom SEO dashboards and track performance over time.
    * When your agent discovers a new, high-authority backlink, post a celebratory message to a [Slack](/docs/integrations/slack) or [Microsoft Teams](/docs/agent-studio/integrationsmicrosoft-teams-integration) channel.
