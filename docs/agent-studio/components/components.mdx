# Components Overview

The SmythOS component system powers your agent workflows. Every agent is built using drag-and-drop components, each representing a task, capability, or utility... from calling an API, filtering JSON, to generating text using a large language model.

<InfoCallout title="What are components?">
Components are modular logic blocks that do something specific inside an agent. You can connect them visually in the Builder, test them individually, and combine them to form powerful workflows.
</InfoCallout>

## Base Components
These are the essential building blocks that help your agents interact, route input, and generate output.

<TipCallout title="Start simple, scale smart">
Use base components to outline your logic clearly before layering in complex conditionals or memory features. se Notes to clarify workflow logic for future collaboratio

## Advanced Components

These components support more complex logic, loops, filters, and low-level execution.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="ForEach" description="Loop over arrays or lists to perform repeated tasks." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/for-each" />
  <Card title="JSON Filter" description="Transform, extract, or restructure JSON responses with precision." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/json-filter" />
  <Card title="Code" description="Run JavaScript logic inline using Node.js and custom logic." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/code" />
  <Card title="Async / Await" description="Control asynchronous flow and coordinate timing-sensitive components." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/async" />
  <Card title="Sleep" description="Pause execution between tasks for better timing control." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/advanced/sleep" />
</CardGrid>

## Crypto Components

Secure operations for signing, hashing, and transforming data formats.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Encode/Decode" description="Convert between formats like Base64 or UTF-8." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/crypto/encode-decode" />
  <Card title="Sign" description="Generate digital signatures and verify payload integrity." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/crypto/sign" />
  <Card title="Hash" description="Hash strings securely using algorithms like SHA256." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/crypto/hash" />
  <Card title="Timestamp" description="Add secure or formatted timestamps to data or logs." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/crypto/timestamp" />

## RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Components

Memory-aware components for knowledge management and dynamic search.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="RAG Remember" description="Store custom facts or content for retrieval later." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-remember" />
  <Card title="RAG Search" description="Search stored knowledge using semantic queries." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-search" />
  <Card title="RAG Forget" description="Delete or update parts of your agent's knowledge." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/rag-data/rag-forget" />
</CardGrid>

## Tool Components

Powerful utilities to connect with browsers, scripts, and live data.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Web Scrape" description="Extract and parse data from public websites and URLs." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/web-scrape" />
  <Card title="Web Search" description="Query search engines and receive summarized results." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/web-search" />
  <Card title="Computer Use" description="Trigger commands and automate desktop-level interactions." to="/docs/agent-studio/components/tools/computer-use" />

## Why Components Matter

<InfoCallout title="The Power of Components">
Components are the building blocks of intelligent agents. They allow you to:
- Build complex workflows without writing code
- Create modular, maintainable agent architectures
- Leverage advanced AI capabilities through simple, controllable interfaces
- Scale your agents' capabilities as your needs grow
</InfoCallout>

## Best Practices
<WarningCallout title="Sensitive data handling">
Avoid storing API keys or secrets directly inside components. Use the Vault for secure access.
</WarningCallout>

- **Keep it Modular**: Use Agent Skills to break down complex workflows into manageable pieces
- **Document Your Work**: Use Notes to explain your workflow's purpose and functionality
- **Test Thoroughly**: Use the Debug mode to verify each component's behavior
- **Start Simple**: Begin with basic components and gradually add complexity
