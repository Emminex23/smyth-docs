# OpenRouter Integration

`OpenRouter` serves as a powerful gateway, enabling the integration of multiple NLP (Natural Language Processing) APIs into your application through a single, unified API endpoint. This tool streamlines the process of calling various NLP services, offering a consolidated approach to handle multiple API interactions.

At `SmythOS`, we've fully integrated `OpenRouter` within our platform, offering custom components that facilitate the easy inclusion of its advanced functionalities into your software solutions. By leveraging `OpenRouter`, you can enhance your application's capabilities, making it more robust and efficient in processing natural language data.

### Settings

To utilize `OpenRouter` through this component, follow these authentication steps to acquire an `API Key`:

1. If you don't already have an account, create one first.
2. Navigate to the [Keys section](https://openrouter.ai/keys).
3. Click the option to create a new key.
4. Copy the `API Key` and enter it into the settings section of the component.

> **Note:** Treat the `API Key` as sensitive data. In `SmythOS`, you can securely manage it using the `Vault` feature. For more details, please refer to [this](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/vault/keysManagement) section in the documentation.

### Outputs

Upon execution, this component produces the following outputs:

- **Response:** The full server response including the text completion.
- **Headers:** HTTP headers providing additional data details.
- **id:** The unique identifier of the completion request.
- **message_content:** The content of the generated message.

> **Note:** Similar to inputs, you can add new outputs by clicking on the `+` button in the `Outputs` section. This feature can come in handy when you aim to extract specific values from the `Response`. Please refer [here](https://app.smythos.com/doc/#/components/APICall?id=example-without-authentication) to see a practical example.
