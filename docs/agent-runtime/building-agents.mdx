# Building Agents with SRE

SRE is a powerful runtime designed to make building  AI agents straightforward and scalable. It provides the core orchestration, security, and infrastructure, which you can use in two flexible ways: visually in **Studio** for rapid, no-code development, or programmatically with the **Smyth SDK** for ultimate control and deep customization.

<InfoCallout title="Why this matters">
SRE gives you full control and flexibility to design agents the way you want. Rapid prototyping, deep customization, and live debugging are all supported.

## Pick Your Workflow

You can build agents using either [**Studio**](/docs/agent-studio/overview), the **[Smyth SDK](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)**, or both. Choose what fits your use case—or [combine them](/docs/agent-runtime/hybrid-workflows) for maximum flexibility.

### Studio (Visual Builder)

-   Drag and drop [components](/docs/agent-runtime/components)
-   Visually connect steps in your agent’s flow
-   Ideal for low-code teams, fast iteration, and cross-functional collaboration
-   Built-in testing, logging, and monitoring

→ **Explore [Agent Studio](/docs/agent-studio/overview)**

### SDK (Code-first)

-   Write and connect components using TypeScript
-   Build advanced workflows with custom logic
-   Type-safe, version-controlled, and CI/CD friendly

→ **See the [SDK Guide](/docs/agent-runtime/sdk-guide)**

## Studio (Visual Builder)

Studio is SRE’s no-code visual environment. It’s great for building agents collaboratively and quickly.

### What you can do

-   Design logic with drag-and-drop blocks
-   Wire inputs and outputs by drawing connections
-   Add LLMs, APIs, data sources, or logic from the [Component Library](/docs/agent-runtime/components)
-   Test, debug, and monitor everything right in the canvas

→ **Try the [Studio Quickstart](/docs/agent-studio/quickstart/quickstart)**

## SDK Programming

The SDK is for builders who want full control in code.

### Key Benefits

-   TypeScript-based and fully type-safe
-   Supports advanced logic, async ops, and [custom components](/docs/agent-runtime/components)
-   Integrates seamlessly with your dev stack (VS Code, Git, CI, etc.)

### Agent Example (Programmatic Flow)

This JSON structure represents a visual connection where an LLM's output flows into a classifier. Studio generates this behind the scenes, but you can inspect or export it too.

```json
{
  "connections": [
    {
      "sourceId": "llm_1",
      "targetId": "classifier_1",
      "sourceIndex": 0,
      "targetIndex": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

### SDK Equivalent

You can create the exact same flow programmatically with the SDK:

```ts
const llm = SDK.GenAILLM({ model: 'gpt-4' }, agent);
const classifier = SDK.Classifier({ classes: ['positive', 'negative'] }, agent);

// Programmatically link them
classifier.in({ Input: llm.out.Reply });
```

## Custom Components and Skills

Want to go beyond what’s in the box? You can extend SRE with your own logic.

### Custom Components

Create reusable logic blocks by extending the base `Component` class:

```ts
export class MyCustomComponent extends Component {
  async process(input, config, agent) {
    // Your custom logic here
    return { result: processedData };
  }
}
```

→ **See how [Components](/docs/agent-runtime/components) work**

### Agent Skills (aka Tools)

You can expose custom logic as callable skills that agents use at runtime.

```ts
const weatherSkill = agent.addSkill({
  name: 'getWeather',
  description: 'Get current weather for a location',
  ai_exposed: true,
  process: async (location) => {
    return { temperature: 72, condition: 'sunny' };
  },
});
```

## Real-time Monitoring & Debugging

No matter how you build, SRE helps you see what’s going on inside your agents:

-   Live updates via Server-Sent Events (SSE)
-   Logs and trace results per component
-   Step-by-step debug mode
-   Dashboards for memory, tokens, and performance

→ **Monitor agents via [Studio's Debugging Tools](/docs/agent-studio/build-agents/debugging)**

## Hybrid Workflows

You don’t have to choose between code and canvas. Use both—at the same time.

-   Start building in Studio, then export to extend with the SDK
-   Use Studio for high-level workflows and the SDK for complex custom skills
-   Export and import component graphs to toggle between modes
